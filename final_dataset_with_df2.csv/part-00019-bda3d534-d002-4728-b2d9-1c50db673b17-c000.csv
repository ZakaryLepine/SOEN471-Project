She wins a fortune, ninety thousand pounds, in a French lottery. According to what we find later, this is 36 times the price of a nice cottage in the country. She walks off her job and returns to her modest apartment to talk to her best friend Binnie Hale (Kate Meadows) and her elderly aunt Lou (Jean Cadell), who uses complaints about her health to get a bit of loving attention. Carol wants to have luxury and fun with her money for a while, and postpone worrying about her future.Carol's fiancé Ronald Bruce (Bruce Seton), after years of hard work, is just about to get a promotion, and does not want to give that up. His refusal to quit his job causes disagreements and they break up.Carol makes living arrangements for Aunt Lou and puts her flat on the market for rent prior to leaving for France to collect her money and travel in luxury. Cultivated bachelor Gerald Lovell (Basil Rathbone) shows up to inspect the flat and says it is just what he needs. He claims to be a wealthy chemical engineer with a passion for his photography hobby, and he takes the modest flat although he could afford something much more expensive, explaining it reminds him pleasantly of his youth.As Carol and Kate get on the boat to go to Paris, they find Gerald is on board. Gerald now turns on the charm, and Carol quickly falls in love with the romantic and sophisticated man, who is a connoisseur of food, art and Paris.Some time later Ronald comes to Paris and seeks out Carol in her luxurious dwelling, having had second thoughts about their breakup, offering to change his work plans, but it is too late. Carol has married Gerald, despite warnings from Kate.Indications that Gerald has major things to hide begin as the couple makes plans to return to England. Gerald claims that bureaucratic problems with his bankers make it necessary for him to borrow five thousand pounds to make the purchase of a charming secluded country cottage, and he gets Carol to sign legal documents without reading the details.As they move into their cottage, Gerald insists on setting his darkroom in the basement, and has strict orders that no one should ever enter it, on the excuse that there are dangerous poisonous chemicals around. Gerald's violent anger when a servant puts a package inside the basement, or when Carol comes in to talk to him there, indicate he is disturbed and possibly dangerous.In the following weeks, Gerald succeeds in isolating Carol so she has no one to talk to. Then he announces that on the day of the town fair they will be leaving for a long trip to a location that only he knows. He shows signs of illness, and Carol insists that he see the local doctor, despite loud protestations from him that doctors are all quacks, and he will refuse to take any medicines.At about this time Carol hears from the servants that the cottage they live in was priced at two thousand five hundred pounds, not the five thousand that Gerald had borrowed. When Gerald hears about this discrepancy, he goes into an angry tirade. At this moment Carols attitude switches from idyllic honeymoon to fear.When Dr. Gribble (Bryan Powley) examines Gerald, he diagnoses Gerald as having a serious heart condition that threatens his life unless it is treated. Gerald dismisses Dr. Gribble completely until the doctor happens to notice a book that Gerald has been reading that denotes a serious interest in criminology. They strike up a conversation on the book and the criminal case histories in it, focusing on Fletcher, a serial murderer of wealthy women who has avoided conviction. Gerald waxes lyrical, enthusiastic and admiring in talking about Fletcher's accomplishments. As Dr. Gribble examines the book section on Fletcher, he says he has the same book at his home but it must be a different printing, as his book has a photograph of Fletcher. The doctor offers to bring his own copy of the book some time, but Gerald says some other time, as they are leaving for a long trip in the following morning.Ronald and Kate show up at the cottage, sensing that something may be wrong. Carol is very happy to see them and wants to invite them to stay for dinner, as she has arranged for a celebration dinner of sorts with the maid Emmy (Joan Hickson). But when Carol goes upstairs to tell Gerald about it, he goes berserk and yells angrily that he won't put up with them for one minute.As Carol is saying a slow good bye to Ronald and Kate, Dr. Gribble comes back to the house with his own copy of the criminal case histories book. A comparison with his copy shows that the portrait of Fletcher has been torn from Gerald's copy. Fletcher has a beard and is blond, while Gerald has a small mustache and is black haired, but we the viewers can recognize him. Carol comments that he does look vaguely familiar.Dr. Gribble leaves, Gerald comes down the stairs and, after dismissing Emmy for the night and until they return, proceeds to lock all doors of the house. By this time Carol becomes very concerned about her own safety as Gerald's psychological problems are increasingly manifest. In order to gain time she goes ahead with the planned elaborate dinner, and in her conversations she is both verifying her worst fears that Gerald is Fletcher and intends to kill her shortly, and planning some sort of escape.As the conversation proceeds, it gets ever more intense, and Gerald notices that a sort of confession is being wheedled out of him. He confesses that he learned that Carol had won the lottery from the agent who was offering the apartment for rent. Leaving little unclear, he talks about why he has murdered several women, his attitudes that no woman could ever match his intellect. Carol in desperation claims that she herself is a murderer that got away with it. As Gerald demands to know more and more details of what and how and why of her murder, just at the moment when he finally decides that she is lying, and he announces triumphantly that he doesn't believe her, she tells him that his coffee has been poisoned, and that she is just making time until he drops dead. She points out to him that she has not taken any coffee at all, and she stares at him.Gerald, taken aback, rises, his weak heart gives out, and he collapses to the floor.Miraculously, at this time, Dr. Gribble, Kate and Ronald arrive, with help from others they break into the locked house, and all is well for Carol at the end.","insanity, romantic",train,imdb

We see the crown, and then the elaborate ritual of coronation. In the sidelines, aristocratic attendees, the boyars, whisper expressing discontent at his elevation. Among them is Ivan's aunt, Efrosinia Staritskaya (Serafima Birman), who wants to advance her son Dmitri, a simpleton.Ivan proclaims his will to recover lost territories, unite and protect Russia against foreign armies outside her borders, and the enemies within, announcing that absolute rule with an iron fist will be imperative. In a series of reaction shots, we see that boyars, officials and clergymen wanted a puppet ruler, and are unpleasantly surprised.Soon Ivan marries Anastasia Romanovna (Lyudmila Tselikovskaya), and a wedding celebration takes place. The marriage causes him to lose his two best friends, Prince Andrei Kurbsky (Mikhail Nazvanov), a warrior who wanted both power and the hand of Anastasia, and Fyodor Kolychev (Andrei Abrikosov). The latter receives Ivan's permission to retreat to a monastery, while Kurbsky insinuates himself to the Tsarina, who repels his advances.The wedding feast is interrupted by news of the burning of several boyar palaces, carried into the Tsar's palace by a mob of the common people who also complain that the Tsar is being led astray by the Tsarina's family, the Glinskys and the Romanovs.Ivan calms the crowd. Fyodor Basmanov (Amvrosi Buchma), a commoner who acted as spokesman for the unruly crowd, is impressed by the Tsar and becomes his loyal supporter.The scene is interrupted by two envoys from the khanate of Kazan, who deliver to Ivan an insulting message and present him, as a gift, with a ceremonial knife with the suggestion that he do himself a favor by using it to commit suicide.Ivan proclaims at once that Russia is at war with Kazan. At the siege of Kazan, A group led by Basmanov digs a tunnel under the city wall and fills it with gunpowder.Kurbsky, nominally in command, is reprimanded by Ivan for senseless brutality: Kurbsky has tied Tartar prisoners within earshot of the walls of Kazan and orders them to shout to the city to surrender.

Sunset Blvd.,1950,110,Drama,8.4,Billy Wilder,Charles Brackett,Erich von Stroheim,Charles Dayton,William Holden,Jack Webb,"\"The film opens with the camera tracking down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California as police cars begin racing down it. The lifeless body of a young man, Joe Gillis (Holden) floats in the swimming pool of a palatial mansion. As the police begin converging on the house Joe's voice narrates, in flashback style, the events leading up to his own murder.Six months earlier, Joe was down on his luck, unable to find work as a screenwriter, having only made a few undistinguished films in his short career. Broke and on the verge of having his car repossessed, with no other options except a low-paying newspaper job in Ohio, Joe tries to persuade Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake (Clark) to buy his most recent script, but fails after script reader Betty Schaefer (Olson) gives Sheldrake a harsh critique of the script in her summation. Joe then tries unsuccessfully to borrow money from his friends. Fleeing from repossession men in his car, one of Joe's tires blows out in front of a large and seemingly deserted mansion on Sunset. Hiding the car in the garage, he sets out to explore the decaying house, when a woman inside calls to him. Mistaken for the undertaker to a recently deceased pet chimpanzee, he is ushered in by the mysterious butler, Max Von Mayerling (Von Stroheim). Meeting the woman who owns the house, he recognizes her as long-forgotten silent-film star Norma Desmond (Swanson). When she learns that he is a writer, she invites him in and asks for his opinion on an immense script she has written for a film about Salome that she hopes will revive her faded acting career. Although Joe finds the script awful, he flatters Norma into hiring him as an editor.Joe is put up in her guest room. The next morning he objects when he sees that Max has moved his belongings to the mansion on Norma's orders, and that she has paid his overdue rent. Though he hates being dependent on her, he accepts the situation and begins living at the mansion, first in a room over the garage, then in the mansion itself. As he works on Norma's script, he comes to see how unaware she is of how her fame has died. She refuses to hear any criticism of her work, and makes him watch her old films in the evenings. Although she still receives fan mail, Joe later learns that Max feeds into Norma's fantasy by sending the letters himself. He explains that Norma's state of mind is fragile, and she has attempted suicide in the past.Over the next few weeks, Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothing, including a tuxedo for a private New Year's Eve party attended only by the two of them. Horrified to learn that she has fallen in love with him, he tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe, thinking his time with her is over, escapes to a party at his friend, assistant director Artie Green's (Webb) house, where he meets Betty Schaefer again. While still unimpressed with most of his work, she believes a scene in one of his scripts has potential. Joe half-agrees to work on it with her, and calls the house on Sunset to tell Max he is leaving. However, when Max informs him that Norma has attempted suicide with Joe's razor blade, Joe leaves the party and returns to the mansion, where he apologizes to Norma and makes love to her.After a while, Norma considers her script complete, and sends it to Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount and waits for his answer. Not long afterwards, calls from Paramount asking for Norma begin to arrive. They come from an executive named Gordon Cole, and Norma petulantly refuses to speak to anyone other than DeMille himself. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to the studio in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A, a rare vintage luxury car. While DeMille entertains Norma, many of the older guards, technicians and extras on the set recognize her and welcome her back. Joe and Max, meanwhile, learn that Cole had called because the studio wants to rent her car and has no interest in her script (DeMille tells an assistant in private that the script is awful). Max insists that they hide these facts from her. He later confesses to Joe that he was once a respected film director who discovered Norma as a girl, and was also her first husband, and that he now remains as her servant because he cannot bear to leave her.While Norma undergoes a rigorous series of beauty treatments to prepare for her comeback, Joe has secretly begun to work with Betty on a screenplay. Though she is now engaged to Artie, she falls in love with him. Although he likes her, Joe is dismayed at the triangle in which he is now caught. When Norma discovers the script with Betty's name on it, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe, hearing her, invites Betty to the mansion to see for herself. When she arrives, he coldly terminates their relationship by letting her believe that he is a gigolo and prefers to live off Norma. After Betty leaves the mansion in tears, Joe begins packing, having decided to return to Ohio. He bluntly informs Norma of the truththat there will be no comeback, her fan letters come from Max, and she is forgotten. He ignores Norma's threats to shoot herself, and in a fit of passion she shoots him as he leaves, leaving him dead in the pool.The scene returns to the opening. Still narrating, Joe expresses fear over how Norma will be unable to cope with the disgrace, and the discovery of how forgotten she truly is. By the time the police arrive, however, she has completely broken with reality and slipped into a delusional state of mind, thinking the news cameras are set up for a film shoot. To help the police coax her down the stairs, Max plays along with her hallucination that she is on the set of her new film. He verbally sets up the scene for her, and yells \"\"Action!\"\"; Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase.

Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured. Because of the measures of success against the Germans he had gained prior to his capture, the lieutenant is a marked man, but he and Sefton are successful in their escape attempt.The elimination of the German informer and the first successful escape by American POWs lift the spirits of the other POWs.================================A few days before Christmas, 1944, at the German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag 17, two American POWs, Manfredi and Johnson, inmates of Barracks 4, are preparing an escape.

After going over their plan to sneak into Switzerland, Manfredi and Johnson get out of the barracks through a trap door hidden under the wood-burning stove and sneak into the latrine. They crawl through the tunnel and begin digging to the surface beyond the barbed wire fence.Inside the barracks, the men speculate as to how long it will take their comrades to emerge beyond the fence.

The other men, most of whom dislike Sefton, wager against him.Outside, Manfredi and Johnson dig to the surface and are about leave when they are spotted by a small German squad outside the fence, who open fire, killing them both. Inside the barracks, the remaining prisoners, including Sefton, are disheartened, knowing their buddies could not possibly have escaped. The hot-headed Duke demands an explanation from the barracks' security officer, Price. Price says he doesn't have an answer. Meanwhile, Sefton and Cookie quietly gather up the cigarettes that Sefton has won in the bet and store them in a footlocker Sefton keeps under his bed.The next morning the entire camp is awakened for roll call.

Butler then shows Barbara her brothers diary found where he was killed. Butler demands to know why her brother was keeping meticulous records of flight operations around the base. Griselle is furious at the invasion of privacy and Butlers very selective reading of the diary. She shows him pages of notes in the diary where her brother was tracking milk production of his herd and trying to correlate the falling production with the increasing aircraft activity.Later Cummings drives Barbara home; he apologizes for Butlers and explains the General had no real malice towards her brother, rather he was just doing his job. She takes the apology on face value and seems engaged by Cummings warm tones of reconciliationAn unknown time later, Cummings is supervising an experimental radar test at the base. It is hoped they can increase the range of current technology and begin directly monitor Soviet air activity in Siberia. The key to success is the amount of power they can run through the system. For this a small atomic reactor was built at the base.The test progresses normally and Cummings begins calling for more power to be delivered.

This seems to have the desired effect of getting the towns energy directed to something positive.Further background information about Walgate comes through from the FBI.

Walgate has worked out the reason for the base and the need for its own nuclear reactor. Although he gets every detail correct, Cummings admits to nothing.Walgate then focuses of the deaths and seems to take an unhealthy interest in the facial expressions of the dead.

How I Won the War,1967,109,Comedy,5.5,Richard Lester,Patrick Ryan,Ronald Lacey,Lee Montague,Jack Hedley,Jack MacGowran,"\"This film contains the memoirs of one Lt. Earnest Goodbody (Michael Crawford) of 3rd troop, 4th Musketeers--albeit presented to us via 2 perspectives.Early on in the film, the lieutenant is captured while attempting to cross the Rhine river and secure the last intact bridge for the Allies (having boarded an inflated raft by himself and been abandoned by his men). He intermittently recounts his story to a German officer (Karl Michael Vogler) while we, the viewing audience, are also treated to what really happened (seeing as he sugar-coats his version of the story).His earliest recollections are of his officer training under Lt. Colonel Grapple (Michael Hordern), who is shown to be as oblivious to the suffering of his charges as Goodbody proves to be. During the introduction of the story (and shortly thereafter), we meet the men under Goodbody's command:Transom--the unit's suffering second-in-command, who proves to be the only true, hard-working soldier in the group. He is reluctant to take charge of the situations they find themselves in but often does. He encourages the others to kill the Lieutenant and resists the temptation several times. Portrayed by Lee Montague.Dooley--the unit's third-in-command. While he and Transom start at the same rank in the beginning (Corporal), he seems more than willing to place most of the rank-induced responsibilities in the other man's hands. In fact, he acts more like a lackey to Transom than an equal. Portrayed by Ewan Hooper.Gripweed--the Lieutenant's batman (appointed personal assistant, as was common at the time in the British Army). He is a compulsive thief and admits to having been a former member of the British Fascist Party. He seems to show some naivete regarding the true nature of war and the incapabilities of his unit and often is found both chiding and being sycophantic towards Goodbody. Portrayed by then-Beatle John Lennon.Juniper--serves as both the unit's crusty old veteran and the would-be comic relief man. He appears more than willing to spur the rest of the group on to do things but is unwilling to do any real fighting. Throughout the film we see him appear in various comedic guises (such as a ventriloquist with a dummy and a clown). He is perceived by the others to be going insane and as the film progresses; he 'promotes' himself both in rank and as a master strategist (using medals taken from dead soldiers). Portrayed by Jack MacGowran.Clapper--the realist of the group. He is constantly harboring the belief that his wife is cheating on him back home (we find out, mere moments before his death, that she was merely making up stories based on the affairs a neighbor of theirs was having). While, like the rest of the unit, he has little respect for Goodbody, he goes to him for advice numerous times. He also endures the most criticism from Transom regarding his general appearance as a soldier (being told he's improperly dressed for merely having his shirt not buttoned right--although Juniper, standing next to him in the particular shot, is dressed as a clown). Portrayed by Roy Kinnear.Drogue--resigned to dying in North Africa (as he points out repeatedly), he is constantly willing off his possessions to other members of the unit. While he's one of the few to show some level of bravery in the film, he is also shown not to be too careful. Portrayed by James Cossins.Spool--the wireless radio operator for the unit (who never gets to do so). The only major fault that can be attributed to him is that he's probably the clumsiest member of the group (he immediately gets a splinter while holding a fake rifle during training and later sets Goodbody up for landing headfirst in a sand pit merely by knocking into him with a ladder). Portrayed by Ronald Lacey.The Melancholy Musketeer (real name not known, even to himself)--the resident coward of the group, who seems to be completely unaware of what he's fighting for, and why he signed up in the first place. He flees for cover in the middle of battle and at one point even abandons the group (only to be picked up later in the film having hidden in a German truck and claiming to have been captured). Portrayed by Jack Hedley.The unit's first assignment is to land behind enemy lines and set up an advance cricket pitch at an oasis. The purpose of the mission: to give Allied soldiers something to look forward to when they take that particular region. Any other unit would have felt disgraced to accept such a mission but Lt. Goodbody takes it with pride (fearing his men will die of boredom otherwise).The mission immediately is bungled when Goodbody accidentally orders signal rockets fired (giving away their position to a nearby German defense post). In the hustle to avoid being cratered, the unit loses half of their vehicles and Dooley is killed.In a twist of surrealism, each soldier that dies under the Lieutenant's command returns immediately after, replaced by a soldier painted to resemble a plastic army man. From Goodbody's perspective, that man is still alive. Footage shown during the death scenes of these characters is tinted a certain color for each incident (green, then pink, then red, then blue), and the dead soldier 'returns' in that color.With half of their vehicles gone and little fuel remaining, Goodbody decides to raid a German fuel dump on their way to the oasis. In spite of mounting excitement from some of the men (Transom and Goodbody, specifically, with Juniper doing a brief standup routine--during which the two others debate whether or not the man has lost his mind), the raid on the fuel dump ends predictably in failure, seeing as only 3 of the men are willing to advance on the outpost once it's realized that the Germans have heavy machine guns. Drogue is killed (foolishly walking out into the line of fire), and Goodbody is nearly killed in a one-on-one fight with an enemy soldier who is promptly killed by Transom with a bayonet. After the retreat, a light plane spots them and attacks. Goodbody ignores the hail of bullets flying around him to point out how to signal an oncoming plane (having mistaken the attacker for an Allied plane) and goes into a minor tantrum upon discovery that their roller full of water is missing. He spots a group of off-duty Italian soldiers playing soccer nearby (who, it should be pointed out, were on the Allies' side by this point) and immediately spouts racial slurs against them and accuses them of stealing their roller. While this is going on, Transom grabs a submachine gun and shoots down the plane--marking their 'first real victory' (as Goodbody puts it).In the ensuing explosion of the plane's wreckage, the Melancholy Musketeer panics and attempts to flee in one of their trucks. Juniper destroys it, leaving the Musketeer to flee with his pants on fire. The rest of the group carries on towards the oasis (eventually having to go on foot, with the dead versions of Drogue and Dooley carrying the water roller). The men stop near the edge of a cliff, only to find themselves in the middle of a minefield. Spool, going mad with dehydration and heat stress, runs to the roller for a drink and begins to throw a fit after the discovery that Gripweed had let the water out to make the roller easy to move. Goodbody ends up being the last one to find out about the mines (having started doing exercises near the edge of the cliff and discovered that the oasis is nearby). In the ensuing chaos, the film breaks the fourth wall and two ladies (played by the actresses who waved to the Beatles early in the film 'Help!') discuss a similar fit suffered by a son of one of the ladies (\"\"He's not dead",they didn't get him. Missing. Turn up he will,"missing he is...\"\").Colonel Grapple arrives moments later (using a jeep he had 'appropriated' from the unit earlier in the film) and gives them some water",and spurs them to carry on and take the oasis. In a lengthy 'death scene' (in which a man in plain clothes delivers a long-winded recount of a joke he gave to his men during the war)

The Rape of the Vampire,1968,95,Horror,5.2,Jean Rollin,Alain Yves Beaujour,Don Burhans,Bernard Letrou,Marco Pauly,Doc Moyle,"\"Three strangers--Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte--are coming to cure four sisters (for want of names, I shall call them Catherine, Nicole, Sylvie, and Marie) of their vampirism. Legend has it that vampire hunters ran a sword through Catherine's heart during the reign of Louis XV, and villagers raped Nicole and blinded Sylvie with a pitchfork. But they neglected to cut off their heads, and so the sisters survived. Today, they live on a manor, surrounded by crosses and protected from the villagers. Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte don't buy the legend. They think the sisters are simply humans who have been driven mad by years of persecution and villagers who think of them as monsters. Curing them will require only dispelling the sisters' belief that they are vampires. The first step is to burn all the crosses around the house. Catherine succumbs to Thomas' promise to cure her, but Marie feels that this is a betrayal and that Catherine must die to protect the other three. Catherine and Marie stage a sword fight, but it is Marie who gets stabbed. The next morning, Catherine goes off with Thomas to see if she can get over her fear of sunlight (she can't).With the crosses removed from around the house the sisters are free to roam.

He is wheeled down the stairs into a basement where we see the experiment is in fact a two headed gorilla (Rick Baker) that Dr. Kirshner has in fact made. The experiment is to determine whether another head can survive on one single body. Dr Kirshner has done this because he hasn't got much longer to live and wants to transplant his still living head from his lifeless body and onto a another donor so that he may continue living and get back to working as the world's most successful surgeon. He approaches the bars of the cage that hold his new creature, even when told not to but he is unafraid. He says that the creature understands him and therefore will not hurt him.Dr Kirshner returns to his hospital institute to over look an operation done by his close friend and associate doctor named Phillip Desmond (Roger Perry). An onlooker asks why during the operation why he cant see more blood. He is told that both patients are hooked up to individual heart and lung machines and the blood is easily passed through plastic tubing all the time during the operation. Dr Kirshner returns back to the basement and his two headed gorilla to remove one of the heads from its body. A cage is opened to allow them to get inside from their original cage. The cage has no bottom layer so they use a table to place the cage on. Kirshner orders his assistants to sedate his creature but plans go awry when the creature is upset about the needle and knocks both the cage off of the table and Dr. Kirshner out of his wheelchair, hurting him severely. It then proceeds to smash up the lab and escapes. Kirshner tells the assistant to get the creature back as he doesn't have much time left to live. The creature runs away and into a supermarket where the assistants chase after it. The gorilla is found eating a banana in the fruit section of the supermarket. Kirshner hires a new doctor to help his friend with the transplant. Little does he realize that the new doctor is an African American and Kirshner hates African Americans. He is a bigot and a racist. He tells the new doctor that his services that were about to start are now no longer required because he doesn't want an African American doctor working anywhere near him or with him. He tells the African American doctor that he will be remembursed for his time and the original duration that he was supposed to be working for. The African American doctor whose name is Dr. Fred Williams (Don Marshall) takes great offence to this.

He is en route in his private Beechcraft Baron.However, an occluded storm front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. That not only affects the Columbia flight but also precludes Freeman making his meeting in Boise. Both flights are diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport.Freeman's small plane and the giant Boeing 747 enter Salt Lake's entry pattern. Air traffic control assigns the jumbo to enter the pattern first at a low altitude of 10,000 feet, followed by the Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is making its final approach, the co-pilot and First Officer Urias (Roy Thinnes) feels a vibration on one of the adjacent panels and rises to check it out. Freeman, anxious about his missed meeting, makes a call to the Salt Lake Tower asking about the delay. The tower confirms that he is second to land after the big jet.

Fortunately, the captain is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch to keep the aircraft in the air before losing consciousness.Nancy informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She is told to stay on the same radio frequency. Nancy gives the assessment of the damage as a large hole on the starboard side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station.Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Flight 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdoch (Charlton Heston), Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's former lover.

After successfully guiding Nancy by radio on how to perform the turn, radio communications are interrupted and the Salt Lake tower is unable to restore contact.With the low-flying plane unable to turn, leaking fuel, and dodging the peaks of the Wasatch Mountains, an air-to-air rescue attempt is undertaken from a jet-powered HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giant helicopter flown by the USAF Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service. While the pilot is preparing to be released on a tether, it becomes apparent that Flight 409 is heading straight into the side of a mountain. With radio communications still out, Nancy flies the plane unaided.The badly wounded Captain Stacey is able to give a cryptic clue regarding the decrease in airspeed during a climb in altitude. Nancy realizes that she must accelerate the engines to be able to climb over the mountain and successfully does so. After Flight 409 has leveled off, the pilot is released on a tow line from the helicopter towards the stricken airliner. Just as Nancy is helping him in, the release cord from his harness becomes caught in the jagged metal surrounding the hole in the cockpit. As he climbs in, his harness is released from the tether and he falls to his death.The only other person on the helicopter who can land a 747 is Captain Murdock. He is tethered to the rear of the helicopter, lowered to the jet and successfully enters it through the hole in the cockpit. Despite the controls being smashed and with serious damage to the landing breaks, he then lands the plane safely at Salt Lake City Airport, where the flight attendants successfully conduct an emergency evacuation of the passengers via the inflatable slides on the left side of the 747.

But they swim into a sunken wreck which is also a piranha lair and they are both killed and eaten by the unseen piranha.The next day, a group of tourists, including Tyler Sherman (Steve Marachuk), are taking the diving courses provided by Anne Kimbrough (Tricia O'Neil), an employee of the Hotel Elysium. One of her divers swims into the wreck, which she has strictly forbidden to her divers. Leaving Tyler to take over and lead the others to the surface, she discovers almost immediately that her 'missing' student has swam into the wreck and been killed there when his badly chewed up body is found.Anne's estranged husband, Steve (Lance Henriksen), a police officer, refuses to listen to Anne about her wanting to have a look at the body, because she needs to know what happened. The death does not seem to match the attack pattern by any of the marine life in this area, which she knows better than anyone. For her not to know what killed a diver is a dangerous sign. Steve intercepts Aaron (Aston S. Young), a dynamite fisherman, and his son, and threatens to confiscate their boat, but as Aaron explains, Steve, Anne, and he, are old friends.Meanwhile, as the guests begin to flirt with each other (a middle-aged widow, named Bevelry, flirts with a younger man, named Leo, who is a dentist), a pair of women, named Jai and Loretta, arrive on a large sailboat. By their own admission, they are sea bandits. One sneaks into the kitchen to steal food, but is intercepted by Mal (Arnie Ross), a cook. She flirts with him, and he offers instead to make her a wonderful dinner. But as he goes to their boat with the meal, they take the meal and then undock, letting the boat drift. They try to convince him to jump, and he tries, and fails, so they mock him and sail off. That night, Jai and Loretta sail too far out, and are attacked by the piranha, who have developed the power to fly. Jai is attacked and her throat ripped out while Loretta falls into the water and gets eaten alive by the fish in the water.Worried about what's going on, Anne finds that she is being frequently bothered by Tyler Sherman, and so she takes him with her to the morgue to get a look at the body. It is revealed there that she became a marine biologist before she married Steve, and so she begins taking pictures. There, she finds that the body of the tourist has been eaten in many parts. A nurse comes in, kicks them out, and ends up quickly dead, for a piranha was hiding in the body and escaped in it. Armed with the power to fly, it kills the nurse by bitting her throat out and escapes out a window into the night.In her hurry, Anne left her credit card behind at the scene. Anne and Tyler have a one night stand back in her room. But the next morning, while he sleeps, she begins to study the pictures, and is horrified by what she discovers. Steve arrives, throwing the card at her, angry first that she went to the morgue in defiance of him, and secondly that she has man in her bed. She tries to warn him of what she's discovered, but he ignores her and thinks she's a murderess.Anne tries to tell Raoul (Ted Richert) the pompous hotel manager, that she's cancelling the dives because it isn't safe. Raoul at first pretends to be concerned, but swiftly fires her, thinking she is crazy. Attempting to capture one for further study, or at the very least take some pictures so she can prove what she's trying to tell Steve and the manager, she is intercepted by Tyler, who swiftly informs her that he is a biochemist and member of a team which has developed the ultimate weapon: a specimen of genetically modified piranha, with some other fish's genes intermixed, capable of flying. Earlier, and unfortunately, the team mistakenly deposited (or lost) a cylinder full of these fish when a cargo ship was sunk the water where the dead couple were found.Aaron provides the proof Anne needs to Steve, calling him and showing him, not merely some flying piranha he's recently caught, and never seen before, but also that they're a serious danger, because they're turning on each other. This is a sign that they're running out of food and will soon attack whatever they come near, including humans.At a meeting, Anne tries her best to reason with Raoul, to no avail. Steve surprises her, standing up for her and proving her case for her by throwing the body of a dead piranha onto the table. Steve tells her that she can't trust Tyler, because the army says he's crazy. She argued that Tyler's just been using her to get the message of the piranha out for him, to protect both himself and the residents of the hotel.Later that evening, a piranha attacks Gabby's son and kills him in his shack, leaving a bereft Gabby to vow revenge by killing the fish in the wreck they hide in. Anne tries to dissuade him, but it's too late. Having ignored Anne's advice, Raoul hosts a nighttime fish party to capture grunion, who come up to the beach to spawn at this time, making them easy prey for humans to capture and kill. Unfortunately for the residents, the piranha are also partially grunion and share the same instinct. During the fishing party promoted by the resort, the piranhas fly out of the water and attack the guests on the beach and at the hotel's courtyard pool. Anne leads those who survive into hotel, where they shut the doors and windows. Aaron tries to attack them, but they overwhelm and kill him as well.In the morning, the piranha withdraw, for Anne had discovered that they are not fond of daylight. Tyler and Anne decide to undertake Aaron's plan, and blow up the ship to destroy the predators. Meanwhile, the situation gets even tenser, for not merely can the piranha fly, but Anne and Steve's teenage son Chris (Ricky G. Paull) has been hired, against their wishes, by a local ship 'Captain', and his lovely daughter Allison (Leslie Graves). Chris and Allison sail away, and strand themselves on an island, leaving them vulnerable to piranha attacks that never actually happen. Getting lost at sea, they try to set sail again, heading straight toward the wreck.When Chris and Allison are stranded in a raft above the shipwreck, Annie and Tyler arrive in a motorboat and don scuba gear to dive down to the wreck to plant the timer charges that Aaron left behind. With only 10 mintues to get out of the wreck before the bomb explodes, Anne and Tyler are trapped in one of the sunken ships rooms by the murderous piranha who all return to the wreck. On the surface, Steve, piloting a police helicopter, ditches the chopper and swims to Anne and Tyler's motorboat where Chris and Allison are. With minutes left to spare before the bomb explodes, Steve powers up the boat and takes off. Down in the wreck, Tyler sacrafices himself to allow Anne to escape out of a porthole and to tie a survival rope around her waste allowing herselt to be pulled away by the motorboat on the surface. At the last second, Anne gets clear and the bomb detonates, destroying the sunken ship and the piranha with it. With all the murderous fish dead, Anne swims to the surface and is picked up by Steve and the two kids in their boat.","horror, violence, mystery",train,imdb

Wings of Desire,1987,128,Drama,7.9,Wim Wenders,Wim Wenders,Lajos Kovács,Bruno Ganz,Sigurd Rachman,Hans-Martin Stier,"\"Note: This film was shot in black/white and color. The Angels cannot see color. Therefore, when the shot is from the angels' point of view, the shot is black and white, and when the shot is from a human point of view, it is in color. There is much poetic language used in this film that simply cannot be properly conveyed.Damiel (Bruno Ganz) is writing on a paper, When the child was a child. He goes through a series of statements about when children were children: what they thought, how they acted, etc. Then, the opening credits appear. It fades to a scene of the sky, then a close-up of a human eye, then a bird's eye view of Berlin.Damiel is looking over the city from atop a large statue. He has wings, but they disappear only a few seconds into the scene. He can hear the people below, but only the children can see him. There is a quick shot of a flapping wing, and then we see one man walking with a baby. While we see this, Damiel speaks about wanting to see color and feel alive.We hear the thoughts of a woman on a bicycle. Damiel is on an airplane, passing through the aisle. He stops to see a little girl. Then, he focuses on Peter Falk (as himself). People's voices are heard.Peter talks to himself about the writer's block he is having over his script. Peter speaks in English. A shot of Berlin is shown from the airplane's view. We hear various radio stations as we see the radio tower over Berlin. The camera pans into an apartment, and we hear various people's thoughts. Many of the things we hear are typical thoughts, or people's problems.Again, Damiel starts to think, When the child was a child. This time he is wondering what children think about. We follow Damiel around his daily routine. First, we fly once more over the city, listening to an ambulance. Then we see the pregnant woman inside the ambulance. We hear the pregnant woman's thoughts. Then, we hear the thoughts of the people in the cars around the ambulance.Damiel sits in a car with Cassiel (Otto Sander). They discuss their log books for the day. As Cassiel speaks, Damiel focuses on a couple embracing each other on the sidewalk. Damiel tells his works of the day to Cassiel. He says how wonderful it is to live for eternity and to hear people's spiritual thoughts. But, he wishes that he could live day by day, be greeted by strangers, and be able to say now, instead of eternity, to do things in pretense. All the wonderful things of living, even things like a fever and black fingers from reading the newspaper, are things that Damiel wants to experience. Then, woman on the sidewalk tells her husband about how she would like to own the convertible in which Damiel and Cassiel are sitting.We move to the library, which is full of noise and full of people's thoughts. There are many other guardian angels there, looking over the shoulder of their selected people. The angels recognize each other and nod hello to one another. Damiel picks up a pencil in spirit, and carries it around with him. Cassiel watches Damiel from a distance. Damiel runs into an old man (Curt Bois). Even though he is old, he wants to tell his story again.Damiel gets on the subway. He scans the people while hearing their thoughts. He sits down next to a man in dire straits. The man feels like life is no longer worth living. Damiel sits down next to him and touches his shoulder. Suddenly, the man's attitude changes and he is ready to solve his problems. He watches two children use a magnet to dig for change in the drain, and then goes to visit the traveling circus.Marion (Solveig Dommartin) practices a new routine on the trapeze. The ringleader criticizes her, but Marion only complains about how difficult it is to perform with her feather wings on. She speaks French, but it is sometimes mingled with German.The film suddenly turns from black and white to color, and we know that we are now watching from Marion's instead of Damiel's perspective. Marion swings on the trapeze. The film transfers back to black and white and a man comes in to say that the circus is broke and must pack up for the season. We hear Marion's thought that tonight is a full moon, the last night of her old performance. She thinks that a trapeze artist always breaks her neck on the night of the full moon. We hear Marion's deep thoughts about her unhappy disposition. She sits outside with her thoughts. She wants someone to love, and to love her, someone to depend on. When she was little, she wanted to live alone on an island, gloriously alone. She doesnt have an identity, and no where to go like a small animal in the forest.She retires to her trailer and puts on a record. Marion sits on her bed as Damiel watches her. She asks herself what she should do now. She thinks about staying in Berlin. She thinks about her final night this evening. She thinks, I think as if I'm talking to someone else. Meanwhile, Damiel looks at the pictures on Marion's mirror. Marion starts to change her clothes. Damiel reaches over to touch her, but he can't because he is not human. Marion says she is looking for the will to love. The film turns to color as she puts on her robe. She juggles three apples, and laughs.Back in b/w film, Damiel comes across a bridge to a motorcycle/car accident. A man sitting on the sidewalk has suffered from a concussion. Damiel holds the man's head, and talks to him. The man starts repeating what he says. Damiel gets up and walks away, and the man is still talking in the background. We hear another man's voice taking over the words of the other man as Damiel walks away. Damiel gets on the train. The voice continues as we see Damiel sitting on a statue overlooking Berlin once again.Cassiel is standing over the old man in the library. The man is surrounded by globes, and he analyses the movement of the solar system. He talks about how the world is changing and fading into dusk. We see him look in a book and reminisce about the past. In the past, he looked up to the warriors and heroes, but now he just lives one day at a time. As the old man reminisces, we see real footage from after the war. Men and women are passing by the ruins in the street. Lots of pictures of dead people and babies on the street, all piled up one-by-one next to each other. Cassiel is looking over the old man's shoulder again. The old man wonders why we cannot just have peace but always war. If he gives up, mankind won't have a storyteller, and humans will forget their childhood.Meanwhile, Damiel sits atop the large guardian angel sculpture monument. The old man walks through a desolate place on the East side of the Berlin wall. He reminisces about what once stood in those places. He is in disbelief that Potsdamer Platz once stood there. Then, he points out where the café Josti used to stand. As he reminisces, we see historical footage of the area. The footage cross-cuts back to the old man and Cassiel. He talks about how the times changed. The flags started appearing, the people or the police were no longer friendly. He will not stop telling his story until the Potsdamer Platz is found again. He sits down in an old chair in the middle of the desolate field, and scratches his head. The old man asks where are the heroes and the children, where are the ones that listen to his stories? We hear helicopters overhead.The old man plays a little musical toy on a street corner. He smiles to himself, and is still reminiscing and looking back on what has happened to society. Cassiel is looking over a railroad and street from atop a building. He finds a young girl who is prostituting herself to escape from her family. She thinks to herself that she needs Klaus because he will take care of her. But, Klaus can't take care of her, she thinks, because he is dead.A car pulls out of a garage. The driver thinks about how there are still so many borders everywhere. He drives through the streets with Cassiel in the car. The German people have divided into as many states as there are individuals, the man thinks to himself. He poetically talks about borders. Again we see real footage of cleanup after the war, from the perspective of a passenger in a car driving by. The driver thinks a little more about the difficult border that the people face today. He pulls into a center.We hear Peter Falk talking from outside the car. He is telling a young boy about the new movie plot. They are making a movie about Hitler, and Peter asks the boy if the plot sounds plausible. A woman takes pictures, and Peter yells at her that they have enough pictures already. He complains to his assistant that he is wearing a dumb-looking hat. They go inside the old building where the movie is being filmed and dig through the hat bin to find the right look for him. He says that wants a hat that makes him look like an anonymous German. He tries on hats in front of a mirror on a movie set, while Cassiel is still watching him.Damiel is also there, but he is watching from the second floor. After Peter Falk finds the right hat, we see all the extras sitting around. Peter compares himself to Columbo. Then, he thinks about dinner, and wonders whether Germans make a certain food or not. The angels look around the room, listening to people's thoughts. Damiel focuses on a woman who is thinking about the past. The scene changes to a historical film, showing the work of the Rubble Women cleaning up all the bricks after the war. She thinks about a house that was half destroyed. We see Damiel again, coming out of the reminiscence.Peter comes up and asks the woman if he can draw her. She allows him. He sketches her, and thinks to himself about her face. He considers what the term \"\"extra\"\" implies; these people are extra people. The woman wonders if he will give her the picture. Peter focuses on his drawing once more.The movie starts filming. Two men are fighting. Cassiel observes as Peter asks the director if the latter has time for an interview with a Berlin television station. The director tells the interviewers that he can do the interview now. Cassiel and Damiel are both listening to Peter's thoughts as he walks away.Damiel says to Cassiel","\"\"Come","I'll show you something else.\"\" They go to the traveling circus where Marion works. The audience is filled with children. A bunch of costumed people come out to entertain",and the little girl sitting next to Damiel keeps talking with him. Cassiel stands at the back of the tent observing. As the performance goes on

Doughboy and his two friends proceed and avenge Ricky's murder, gunning down his killers in cold blood.The film ends the following morning with a conversation between Tre and Dough Boy.

When Grey accidentally collides with Bill for real, she insists on putting the two up for the night, even over the objections of her snotty fiance Walker McCormick. After a confrontation with Bill exposing the truth of the con, Grey lets them stay for as long as they need when she understands the precarious position the homeless pair are in. One night, Bill tells Grey that he is not Sue's father, he met Sue's mother one night in Florida. After Sue's mother died, Bill raised her himself, growing to love her like his own, thus when they lost their home and money, Bill could not find it in his heart to give Sue up and put her into an orphanage, so he took Sue with him. Grey, thinking Bill has been neglecting and abusing Sue by using her in his cons and scams, suggests Sue stay with her when he leaves, but this only angers Bill, who says that after all the years he looked after her, if he gave up Sue now, people would make fun of her for being on welfare. He tells her that he is not neglecting or abusing Sue; he cares about Sue and his cons are to provide for Sue. However, when it becomes apparent that Sue is completely unable to read or write (despite spelling a difficult word earlier), Grey begins to push even harder for Bill to leave Sue with her. Eventually, Bill realizes that this is where she belongs - in a home, cared for by someone that can give her the advantages that his homeless, nomadic existence lacks. Walker turns them in and Sue gets put into welfare. Bill is arrested, because he never actually had custody of the child. Eventually, Grey gets Sue out and Bill is freed. Sue and Grey return to their apartment, and discover a tin ring (the one which was stolen earlier), which Sue takes as a sign that Bill chose to leave her behind with Grey. (It is implied that Bill pawned a ring left to Sue by her mother, which he would return to her when it came time for the two to part forever) However, the ring is accompanied by a note that says that he is in another room. Sue happily turns to find Bill, realizing that the ring is not a sign that he will leave her but a sign that he is going to abandon his old lifestyle in order to give Sue the home she needs and in order to pursue a romance with Grey.","romantic, melodrama",train,wikipedia

When they come back home, they find the Houses' door open and a crowd of neighbors gathered around the door. Lilian has just died from a heart attack. Larry and Carol are surprised by this death because Lilian seemed so healthy.A couple of days later, on their way to the Met, Larry and Carol meets Paul in the street and Carol finds Paul's cheerfulness slightly suspicious. Later in the evening, in a restaurant, she talks about it with their friends Ted (Alan Alda), Sy and Marilyn. Ted is just divorced, and Larry thinks he is in love with Carol. Carol explains that Lilian House didn't seem to have a heart condition. And Ted says that Paul could have killed her to run off with his «tootsie». But Larry is very doubtful about it, and just thinks that Paul is a strong guy, who tries to hide his true feelings.Knowing he likes sweet food, Carol makes floating islands for Paul and bring them to him. While Paul and Larry are talking in the living-room, Carol is making coffee in the kitchen and she finds a funerary urn hidden in a cupboard, seeming to refute Paul's claim that Lilian was buried.

The urn is missing, but she finds two plane tickets to Paris and a reservation for a Paris hotel for Paul and a woman named Helen Moss. From Paul's apartment, she calls Ted to tell him about it, but Paul unexpectedly returns, and Carol hides under the bed. She overhears a telephone conversation between Paul, calling himself Tom, and a woman whom she supposes to be Helen Moss. After Paul's departure, she leaves the apartment but realizes later that she left her eyeglasses in Paul's apartment. When she tells Larry what she's done, he is furious about it.Carol makes a chocolate mousse and brings it to Paul so that she can retrieve her glasses, but Paul finds them first, causing Larry and Carol to try awkwardly to explain why the eyeglasses were under his bed.Ted finds out where Helen Moss lives. He and Carol sit in his car outside her apartment and when she comes out, they follow her to the old cinema theatre that Paul owns. They hide inside the theatre and find out that Helen Moss (Melanie Norris) is a young, beautiful actress looking for a job. While eavesdropping on Paul and Helen, they hear the couple talking about the money they're going to get from selling the theater. Paul and Helen are interrupted by the arrival of Gladys Dalton (Marge Redmond), Paul's only assistant, who is a middle-aged woman walking with a cane.In the middle of the night, while Paul is away, Carol goes back in his apartment, taking a very frightened Larry along with her. She presses the «last number dialed» button on the telephone and someone named «Waldron» answers the phone. Larry inadvertently breaks a statuette in the bedroom, and picking up the debris, Carol finds a suspicious pair of gloves.Going out of the restaurant were they have been celebrating their son (Zack Braff) Nick's birthday, Larry and Carol meet Marcia Fox (Anjelica Huston), an author and a client of Larry. When Marcia is gone, Larry explains to Carol that he wants to «fix» Marcia with Ted, but Carol doubts it would work.Later, Carol meets Ted in a lounge for a wine-tasting party. Ted drinks a bit too much wine and confess to Carol he is in love with her. He goes away and Carol remains seated near the window, looking absently at the street, when, in a bus, she sees a woman that looks very much like the deceased Lilian House. When, back home, she tells Larry about it, Larry answers that she had certainly drunk too much wine. To please Carol, he even suggests that Lilian could have a twin.Next day, Carol goes back, with Ted, to the place where she saw the bus. Ted has been investigating and found that Lilian had a sister and a brother, but no twin. A bit further down on the street, they find a «Hotel Waldron», «Waldron» being the name Carol was given when she called the «Last Number Dialed» on Paul's telephone. Ted calls the hotel from a pay-phone, and finds there is no Mrs House and no Miss Moss staying at the hotel.Meanwhile, in a empty restaurant, Marcia is giving Larry a poker lesson. While playing, Larry tells Marcia about his feeling that Carol is having an affair with Ted. Marcia tells him he should try to involve himself in Carol's investigation despite having denounced it as foolishness.So Larry goes along with Carol to spy on the Waldron Hotel from their car and they see Lilian House entering the hotel. They question the hotel clerk (Aida Turturro) and find that Lilian is staying there under a false name. On the pretense of giving her a birthday present, they go to her room and find her dead on the floor. They rush out of the hotel and call the police, but when, a bit later, the police eventually search the room, they don't find anyone in the room, not even a dead body. Nevertheless, one of the policeman gives his business card to Larry.Much later in the evening, Larry and Carol come back to the street near the hotel and, from the street, they see a light in Lilian's room. Using the business card the police officer gave him, Larry pretends to be a policeman. The night clerk (Yanni Sfinias), who has never seen them before, let them go into Lilian's room, which they start searching for clues. And they find Lilian's wedding ring. While leaving the hotel, they get stuck in the elevator, triggering Larry's severe claustrophobia. Carol opens the emergency exit panel to escape and finds Lilian's body hidden on the roof of the elevator cabin. The lights go out, and the elevator rides down to the basement. When they exit in the back street behind the hotel, they see Paul putting a wrapped body in the trunk of his car.Carol and Larry follow him out of the city to a junk yard. Paul dumps Lilian's body on a pile of scrap metal, and it is dropped into a melting furnace with the metal. Larry and Carol are helpless and the evidence of murder is destroyed.They come back home, and as they reach their building, they see Paul coming out of it, walking slowly because he is accompanied by Gladys Dalton. He says they've been watching Madame Bovary and she confirms his alibi.Larry and Carol know that Ted is having diner with Marcia in a restaurant called Vincent's and they decide to meet them there. The four of them discuss the mystery and try to solve it. Larry remembers that, when they came home, the night of Lilian's death, the body was already covered with a sheet and they never actually saw it. Carol is also sure it was Paul they saw cremating his wife's body in the junk yard. Marcia thinks that Paul has committed the perfect murder. And she explains it :The night of the murder, they had a guest, who looked a bit like Lilian, and this guest had a heart attack. After her death, Lilian dressed her with her own clothes, and then hid somewhere in the apartment, while Paul was waiting for the doctor. When the doctor and the paramedics were gone with the body, Lilian went to the Waldron hotel under a false name. But Paul had been cheating on his wife with Helen Moss for a long time, and he decided to double-cross her and kill her, taking her share of the profits. Gladys Dalton is in love with Paul and she lied both to the police about Paul being working with her while he was killing his wife in the hotel, and to Larry and Carol about Paul watching Madame Bovary with her while he was cremating his wife in the junk yard.Carol gets a bit jealous of Marcia getting all the attention from both Larry and Ted, because of her brilliant explanation of the mystery, so acrimoniously she says Marcia has no proof about Paul being the murderer. But Marcia answers she has a plan to make Paul confess the murder.Ted owns a theater and Marcia, Larry, Carol, Ted, Sy and Marilyn use it to stage a fake audition, to which they ask Helen Moss to come. They tape-record the whole audition, and then Sy edits the tape, changing the sentences Helen said to fit in the fake dialogue they need to trap Paul. To be sure Helen won't be with Paul when they call him, Ted meets Helen in a bar to talk to her about the stage play he supposedly wants her to be part of.Meanwhile in Sy and Marilyn's apartment, Carol, Larry, Sy and Marilyn each have a small tape machine which they play in turn to give Paul, whom they are calling, the impression that he is actually getting a call from Helen. Helen's faked call suggests that «his neighbors» have his wife's body and that they want $200,000 for it. Either he pays them or he kills them. Marcia believes that Paul will try to kill them, and the police can then catch him in the attempt.After the call, Paul meets Gladys outside his office in the movie theatre. Seeing him worried, she tells him she is always available if he needs help, but he gets mad at her and tells her to stop interfering with his business.Meanwhile, in the street outside Sy and Marilyn's building, Carol is getting mad at Larry, whom she accuses of being in love with Marcia. She eventually tells him she feels like being alone for a while and she walks away.A bit later, as scheduled by Marcia, Larry calls Paul from a pay phone, telling him he has a «package» that is going to cost him $200,000. But what he doesn't know is that Paul has kidnapped Carol. And Paul answers that he also has a package for him, and, to prove it, he gets Carol on the phone. He then asks Paul to bring Lilian's body to the movie theater.Larry goes to the theater with a dummy in the trunk of his car. When he sees it, Paul gets mad and the two men start fighting on the parking lot of the theatre, but Larry breaks away from Paul and rushes into the theatre. He starts searching for Carol, but becomes disoriented by an array of mirrors behind the theater screen, mirrors which are reflecting the movie being played (Orson Welles's «The Lady from Shanghai»). Paul stalks him with his gun in hand, but he is shot by Gladys, who doesn't want Paul to drop her for Helen. Meanwhile, Larry rescues Carol and they call the police. They're both in love with each other again.Later, Marcia explains to Ted what exactly happened. The dead body in the apartment was Lilian's rich sister, who bore a strong resemblance with Lilian. The sister had a heart attack while having dinner with them, and the Houses took advantage of the situation. Lilian ran away from the apartment to hide at the hotel Waldron under a false name while Paul was showing the doctor his dead «wife». Pretending to be her sister, Lilian changed her sister's will naming Lilian and Paul as her sole beneficiaries. But Paul double-crossed her, killed her and cremated her, so he could run off with Helen. Gladys covered for him, because she was in love with him, but without knowing he actually was a murderer.Marcia and Ted are starting a romantic relation, and Larry and Carol are acting as a couple of young lovers !","comedy, mystery, murder, flashback",train,imdb

After grabbing Arnie's meager supply of cocaine and pot they threaten him until he snitches on the robbers.Back at Zipper's, the barman is so annoyed at Neil he declares the bar closed and tells everybody to leave.

Leaving them to continue, he now turns his attention on Kitten, ordering her to give him a lap dance up on stage. Kitten tells him she is too scared, but he threatens to kill her if she does not comply. Her eyes are wide with terror she gives him a dance with her fear somehow increasing its eroticism. Not satisfied with letting her strip off just her top, he makes her continue until she is only wearing stocking and high heels and only then allows her to return to Sandra's sheltering arms.Meanwhile the cops, done with Arnie, pull up in front of Zipper's.

Kitten tries to crawl over the bar to safety, but is shot by Neil. Frankie runs toward the back door and is also shot. One of the bullets goes stray, through the back door, and hits cop Joey in the head.Sandra jumps behind the bar and grabs the shotgun. She stands up and takes a shot at Neil, but misses. Outside an enraged Roland blows the door open with his shotgun. Seeing Sandra behind the bar with a weapon, he blasts her. Neil fires at Roland, but Buzz, who has been faking being unconscious on the floor, chooses the wrong moment to make a run for it and gets hit in the crossfire.Roland chases Neil down the stage and behind the curtains blasting away with the shotgun. Thinking Neil is dead he approaches the center of the curtain and is killed when Neil comes out from the far end. Carey retrieves the gun from the floor and confronts Neil. Neil, knowing that Carey has never fired a gun in his life laughs at him, but Carey, enraged by what Neil has done to Christina, empties the gun into Neil's chest. As Neil lies dying, Carey rushes to embrace Christina, who is propped up in the corner bleeding. She opens her eyes and asks if he has a cigarette and we realize she is still alive.In the final scene we see Christina being wheeled out to an ambulance while Carey follows. They are apparently the only survivors of the evening's slaughter. As they get in the ambulance Carey tells Christina he is rethinking his stand on commitment.","cult, murder",train,imdb

Her husband barely manages to escape the flaming ruins of the sinking vessel and reunites with her in the rowboat. As the storm continues, they turn warily towards the dark shadow of land on the horizon.On the mainland, in the jungles of Africa, a family of gorillas is settling down for the night. Young mother Kala (Glenn Close) and her mate Kerchak (Lance Henriksen), the leader of the clan, rest with their baby.The human family makes it to shore by morning and scope out their surroundings before deciding to build a new life for themselves. They construct a tree house using material from the wreckage while Kerchak and Kala play happily with their baby. Everything seems right until one night, while Kala and Kerchak are sleeping, their baby strays from the nest, chasing a butterfly. The leopard, Sabor, on its nightly prowl, comes upon the baby gorilla which cries out before being swept away. Kala and Kerchak run to the rescue, but arrive too late. Kala, grief-stricken, stays at the rear of the clan as they move to new nesting grounds the next morning. Suddenly, she hears a crying sound and runs through the jungle towards the source. She soon comes upon the tree house the human family had built and cautiously enters the dwelling. The place is in shambles; wind blows through a broken window and a spent shotgun lies on the floor. Kala notices shapes in the corner of the room and sees the outlines of two bodies against the wall. Bloody paw prints are scratched into the floor. Startled, she backs up onto a picture frame showing the faces of the family, including the baby. The cry starts up again and Kala finds the human baby still lying in his crib. They investigate each other for a moment and Kala is overcome with maternal instinct, deciding to adopt the baby. Before she can leave, Sabor, who had been hiding in the rafters, attacks. Kala manages to escape by jumping into the rowboat hanging outside the tree house, leaving Sabor tangled in the mess of ropes.Kala returns to the gorilla clan and shows her new baby to the other females, who react with confusion. Kerchak is not keen on the idea of Kala keeping a baby that is not of their kind and demands that she take it back. On Kala's fierce insistence, however, he allows her to keep the baby as long as it was alone but refuses to acknowledge it as his son. A young gorilla named Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) takes a liking to the baby, though she doesn't quite agree with his new name, Tarzan.Tarzan (Alex D. Linz) grows into a strong young boy with a penchant for mimicking animal noises, though he has a hard time keeping up with the moving clan. His best friend Terk looks out for him and always makes sure that he stays away from the disapproving eyes of Kerchak, but her friends label Tarzan a 'hairless wonder' and refuse to play with him. Determined to prove himself, Tarzan follows Terk and her friends to a cliff side where, in an attempt to intimidate him back to the clan, Terk instructs him to retrieve an elephant hair as a way of impressing her friends. However, Tarzan takes this ruse seriously and leaps off the cliff, belly-flopping into the water below. He quickly learns to swim and heads towards a herd of bathing elephants. A young and germophobic elephant named Tantor (voiced as adult by Wayne Knight) mistakes Tarzan for a piranha, despite there being no piranhas in Africa. Tarzan manages to grab onto one of the elephants tails but incites panic on the whole herd who form a stampede and run ashore. Terk's friends are chased back towards the clan and, while no one is hurt in the stampede, Kerchak is forced to rescue a baby gorilla before its trampled. An unconscious Tarzan is pulled ashore by Terk. Tantor, still believing that Tarzan is a piranha, pulls Terk away until Tarzan comes to, revealing a single elephant hair in his hand. Kerchak and the other gorillas arrive and demand to know what started the stampede. Tarzan confesses and tries apologizing to Kerchak who argues Kala's defense to give Tarzan another chance. When Kerchak angrily states that Tarzan will never become one of the clan, Tarzan runs off. Later, he angrily splashes mud onto his face, thinking that it might make him look more 'gorilla'. Kala appears and affectionately shows him that they are actually one and the same; same hands, same eyes, same heart. Filled with a renewed sense of motivation, Tarzan promises to be the best ape ever.As he grows older, he learns to gain strength and inspiration from other animals of the jungle including creating his first spear after watching a rhino scratch a tree with its horns. Now an adult, Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn) has become stronger and swifter, managing to travel faster than the gorilla troop by surfing through the trees. During a wrestling match with Terk, the gorilla troop is attacked by Sabor. Kerchak rises to the defense but is overpowered. Seeing this, Tarzan swings in brandishing his spear and engages Sabor in a fierce battle, eventually coming out victorious. He presents the body of Sabor to Kerchak who reacts respectfully to Tarzan. The heartfelt moment is interrupted by a loud noise which encourages the gorillas to move out but arouses Tarzan's curiosity. He soon comes upon a trio of humans consisting of Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), his daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and their guide Clayton (Brian Blessed). Porter is on an expedition to study gorillas and becomes particularly excited when he stumbles on a nesting site; this proves his theory that gorillas are primarily social creatures that live in family groups. Jane shares his enthusiasm but Clayton remains under the impression that gorillas are wild, savage beasts. Tarzan is nearly discovered by the trigger-happy Clayton before the trio continues on its way. Jane stays behind when she comes across a baby mandrill baboon and whips out a sketchbook to draw him. The baby, taking a fancy to the drawing, steals it and runs off. Jane takes the drawing back from him which makes him cry, attracting the rest of his family, a rather large baboon troop, and they begin to chase Jane. Tarzan, watching all this from above, swings down and rescues Jane before she can fall into a chasm. Tarzan uses his acrobatic skills to navigate the tree tops and elude the baboons, but not before giving the drawing back to the baby.Tarzan brings Jane to a sheltered spot in the trees and recognizes her as someone like him. He gently holds her hand up to his and listens to her heartbeat, much to her discomfort. His ability to mimic allows him to make vocal contact and they successfully introduce each other. Then, Tarzan carries Jane and swings out of the trees towards Jane's campsite where they heard additional shots from Clayton's gun.Meanwhile Terk, a small band of gorillas, and Tantor are looking through the jungle for Tarzan. They soon come across the Porters' campsite and begin playing and making music with what they find, creating a large mess in the process. Tarzan and Jane arrive and Jane realizes, as Tarzan and Terk are reunited, that he's one of them. The rest of the gorilla troop arrives at the camp, attracted by all the noise, including an angry Kerchak. He orders the troop, and Tarzan, to leave before Porter and Clayton return. Jane tells them what happened and dreamily mentions how she met Tarzan.Despite Kerchak's warning that the gorillas must avoid the humans, Tarzan is adamant about continuing to visit them and angrily asks his mother why she didn't tell him there were other creatures like him. Over a period of time he goes back to the camp where Jane and Porter teach him English and all about the human world. After a while, they ask him if he can lead them to where the gorillas are, but Tarzan refuses, remembering how Kerchak felt about the humans. Clayton appears to be the most frustrated by this news. On one return to the camp, Tarzan discovers that more men have arrived and are loading items out of camp and towards a large steamer that is anchored off shore. Jane explains that they are to go home to England and asks Tarzan to go with them. When Tarzan realizes that he won't be able to come back to the jungle, he implores Jane to stay with him. She tearfully says no and runs away. Clayton slyly proposes to Tarzan that Jane will stay longer if she could see the gorillas, so Tarzan agrees to take them.In order to lead the Porters to the gorilla troop safely, he persuades Terk and Tantor to disguise themselves as the humans and lure Kerchak away. The plan works and Tarzan leads the humans to the troop. Everything appears to go smoothly until Terk and Tantor appear suddenly with Kerchak right behind. When he sees the humans he stops in shock but attacks Clayton when he sees him pointing his gun at another gorilla. Tarzan tackles Kerchak and holds onto him while Jane and the others escape. Tarzan then releases Kerchak, nearly choking him, as the troop watches. Tarzan tries to apologize but Kerchak accuses him of betraying the family. That night, Kala approaches a confused and forlorn Tarzan and takes him to the tree house where she found him. There, Tarzan discovers his true past and finds out who his real mother and father were. Kala advises him that no matter what he decides, he must do what makes him happy. Tarzan decides to leave with Jane and the others, donning a suit that belonged to his father. Before he leaves, however, he tells Kala that no matter where he goes, she will always be his mother.Tarzan leaves with Jane, her father, and Clayton the next morning, boarding a small dinghy towards the large steamer. Once on board, however, Tarzan is greeted by fierce looking thugs who force Jane and Porter into the hull of the ship.

U.S. Marshals,1998,131,Action,6.6,Stuart Baird,Roy Huggins,Robert Downey Jr.,Joe Pantoliano,Tommy Lee Jones,Daniel Roebuck,"\"The film opens with closed-circuit television footage of an exchange between two men taking place in a parking garage, which appears to be foiled by agents of the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). The two agents appear to be shot and killed by one of the two men making the meeting.The scene cuts to Chicago, where a tow truck driver named Mark Warren (Wesley Snipes) is driving down a highway while he returns a car to an impound lot. He suddenly has to swerve to avoid a distracted driver, and loses control of his truck. The truck crashes through several construction barriers, then is launched into the air and turned over its side as it skids into an intersection. Warren survives, although his left arm is broken in the accident. Within minutes, the police and the fire department arrive to extricate Warren from the truck. While Warren is being carted away in an ambulance, a firefighter makes an unusual discovery: a gun stashed inside the truck, velcroed underneath the dashboard.We cut to a South Side neighborhood, where a group of US Marshals led by Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) along with his team, comprised of Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Bobby Biggs (Daniel Roebuck), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Savannah Cooper (LaTanya Richardson), are staking out an apartment building where they believe two fugitive brothers, Michael and Greg Conroy, who escaped from a Tennessee state prison are hiding with their girlfriends. Gerard is stationed on a street corner, disguised as a chicken mascot offering free samples to passerby while advertising his food truck parked on the corner. Biggs is stationed nearby, disguised as a construction worker, as is Renfro. Newman and Cooper are stationed behind the building.While acting his part, Gerard sees a stationwagon pulls up and park outside the building. He watches as the fugitive brothers and their girlfriends climb out of the car and head inside with groceries. Once they're inside, he starts walking towards the building, removing his chicken feet and head and producing his pistol, and is joined by Biggs and Renfro. They advance up to the front door of the suspected hideout. On Gerard's signal, Biggs smashes the door open with a sledgehammer. Biggs and Renfro immediately draw their guns on Michael, who immediately fights back as they try to secure handcuffs on him. Gerard gets attacked by the girlfriends when they try to intervene, but he manages to overpower both of them. Greg Conroy attempts to flee out the back door, only for Newman and Cooper to burst in and pin him to the wall. His infant son starts crying and he immediately makes a move for the baby's crib, ostensibly to comfort it. However, Newman shoots him in the shoulder as he tries to draw a shotgun. Gerard picks up the shotgun and manages to use it to briefly hold Michael, who's been trying to fight off Renfro and Biggs this whole time, at bay. Renfro starts to secure the handcuffs on Michael, who suddenly yells in pain and bites Biggs's left shoulder, forcing Gerard to crack him over the head with the butt of the shotgun.Gerard and his men later celebrate the arrest of the Conroy brothers at a bar, as they watch a newscast of the brothers being led to the courthouse in handcuffs. Both brothers have made excessive force complaints against Gerard, with Michael having required 27 stitches after Gerard struck him with the shotgun.Meanwhile, Mark Warren is taken to Chicago Memorial Hospital, where his left arm is put in a cast and he is given a neck brace as support. His girlfriend Marie Bineaux (Irène Jacob) is there waiting to pick him up when he's released, as she pays for Warren's bill in cash. One of the police officers from the scene of the accident is also there, ready to pick up Warren on an illegal gun possession charge due to the gun found in the truck (thanks to Chicago's strict gun laws). The moment Warren is released from the hospital, the Chicago Police immediately arrest Warren and take him into custody.Warren is taken to an interrogation room, where three detectives show up to question him. The lead detective informs Warren that there's been a slight discrepancy: his name flags a white man with long hair. When asked if he's aware of the strict gun laws Chicago imposes, Warren dismisses it by asking, \"\"You ever try towin' a car on the Dan Ryan at three o'clock in the morning without a handgun?\"\" The detective then asks Warren if he's ever been to East 42nd Street and First Avenue in New York City",the scene of a brutal double homicide the previous December. Warren denies it,but the detective then reveals that Warren's fingerprints flagged him as Mark Roberts,the man wanted on a federal arrest warrant for the murders

The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store.

After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Later, Park calls Yu and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around Seoul, and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off.

Oldboy,2003,120,Action,8.3,Park Chan-wook,Garon Tsuchiya,Oh Tae-kyung,Yoo Ji-tae,Choi Min-sik,Oh Dal-su,"\"The film begins in medias res, with the silhouette of a man holding onto a rope-like object -- a neck-tie, by which one man is dangling another off the edge of a building. The man holding the neck-tie is Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), who commands the other man to hear his story.The movie then cuts backward to the year 1988. Dae-su is a Korean businessman with a wife and daughter. On his daughter's fourth birthday, he is picked up by police for being drunk and disorderly. He harrasses several other people at the police station, showing them the angel's wings he bought for his daughter. Finally, he has to be bailed out by his old friend, Joo-Hwan. While Joo-Hwan is in a phone booth talking with Dae-su's daughter, Yeun-Hee, and his wife, Kim Ja-Hyun, Dae-su is kidnapped by unidentified people.Dae-su next appears in a private prison resembling a shabby hotel room. He has been kept there for two months with no word of who is holding him there or why. He receives food through a small hatch at the bottom of the door, and is gassed into unconsciousness whenever he becomes suicidal, or when his holders need access to the room (e.g. to maintain it; cut his hair). His only contact with the outside world is through the television, from which he learns one day that his wife has been murdered, his daughter has been sent to foster parents and that he is himself the prime suspect; his captors took blood and other items from him, and have presumably left enough evidence at the crime scene to implicate him as the perpetrator. This, together with his continued captivity, causes Dae-su to slide into near-madness and violent hallucinations.Attempting to get a grip on his sanity and determine his captor, Dae-su fills several notebooks with an autobiography-prison diary, listing everybody whom he could have possibly wronged in the past, but is unable to figure out who would hate him so profoundly as to imprison him like this. From year 5 on, he starts to tattoo lines in his arm for every year he is imprisoned, and forces himself to train by shadowboxing, punching at the walls of his prison until thick calluses form on his knuckles. When one of his deliveries of fried dumplings turns out to have an extra metal chopstick, he conceals it and uses it to slowly dig a hole into one of the walls. Over the next ten years, he works out, follows current events on TV, and loosens enough bricks to glimpse the outside world. He calculates that he will need another month to make the hole large enough to escape.That night, he is gassed again and a lady hypnotizes him. He wakes up to unfamiliar surroundings. Just as abruptly as he was captured, Dae-su is set free on the rooftop of a building that has been constructed over the place where he went missing. He has a new suit of clothes and his prison diaries. Adjusting to the bright afternoon light, he sees another man sitting on the edge of the building with his small dog. The first human being he has interacted with in fifteen years, Oh Dae-su is taken aback, unable to have a proper conversation with him. We learn that the man is suicidal and says to Dae-su, \"\"Even though I'm no better than a beast","don't I have the right to live?\"\". He then attempts to jump off the edge",but Oh Dae-su grabs his neck tie,saving him from death. Dae-su tells the man to delay his death

Matt at first doesn't seem interested, but then seemingly out of empathy for the young lad, follows Peter out and goes with him to the home of his brother, Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens). Kenny knows of Matt's work as a private investigator and offers him $20,000 to find the men that kidnapped and killed his wife, despite Kenny paying the ransom they requested. Matt figures out that Kenny is a drug dealer. Kenny corrects him and says he is a drug trafficker. And he should know the difference. Matt refuses to help him, assuming he simply wants to exact vigilante justice. He closes the lid on the money offered and abruptly walks out.Matt attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.Matt returns to his apartment and finds Kenny sitting in the hall outside his apartment waiting for him. He tells her his wife's name (Carrie) to assure Matt that he did care about his wife. Through a flashback, we see the moment Kenny got the phone call from the kidnappers demanding a ransom of $1 million. The kidnapper arrives at this figure by estimating the weight of his wife and how much the equivalent weight in cocaine would fetch. The kidnapper emphasizes he would easily pay this amount for the illicit powder, surely the flesh of his wife should be worth as much. Kenny emphatically pleads he doesn't have that kind of money. The kidnapper casually agrees to cut it in half and demands $500,000. Kenny holds firm and haggles him down to $400,000.To prove that he does in fact have her, the main kidnapper provides a physical description of Carrie's breasts. He threatens to cut off one of Carrie's breasts and send it to Kenny as further proof that he has her. Kenny complies and brings the money to the area described and waits as instructed for Carrie to be placed back in his car. However, She never arrives. He is then told she will be at their home. Kenny races home to find her still absent. He is then told to look in the trunk of an old car in Red Hook. There are several bags in there. Kenny picks one up and cuts it open. Blood spills out.Kenny hands Matt a tape recorder that was left in the trunk. Matt listens to it after Kenny leaves. It contains a recording of Carrie in the throes of the horror the kidnappers perpetrated on her. Carrie is complimented on her beautiful breasts. Whether through fear or sexual arousal, the topless Carrie is able to maintain erect nipples in front of her kidnappers until she screams as her torture and mutilation apparently begins. This gives Matt cause to investigate.Matt looks around Red Hook to get leads. What he knows is that the kidnappers were most likely involved with the D.E.A.

When Damian asks the man if he's poor, the man replies in an affirmative, and Damian rushes back to the house for some money. Instead, Anthony accompanies Damian, and gives the man a jar full of coins.

Suddenly, the attic's door is flung open, and his father and Anthony appear. Damian does not explain about the 'poor man,' but finally comes clean to their Dad about the money they found, explaining how he thought it was 'from God.'Returning to their home, they find it ransacked (most likely by the 'poor man'). It is then that the boy's Dad decides to spend what's left of the money. Damian strongly protests that it isn't right since it isn't their money, but their Dad insists that since they have been burgled, it's only fair that it be put to use to fix their Christmas.Damian goes to sleep, upset at his Dad's plans, but before he goes to sleep, the attic hatch opens in his room, and the 'poor man' emerges, who had been hiding in the house the entire time, insisting to Damian that he will return tomorrow to collect the money, before sneaking out of the house.The next day, along with Dorothy, who they let in on the secret, the family goes into town, and after exchanging all the pound notes for Euros, spend what they can, but not all of the money.The family and Dorothy celebrate later on, though Anthony grows angered when it appears that Dorothy and their Dad are getting more and more close. Anthony then blames Damian for this happening.Damian, confused and still upset over the money, leaves the house with the duffelbags. Once he has done so, a number of people show up at their home, asking their Dad for donations and handouts. Meanwhile, the 'poor man' is caught sneaking into the house by the police.Damian takes the bags to the nearby train tracks, and sets the remaining cash on fire.

Grainy historical film depicts violent riots in Boston during earlier generations. Costello, proudly Irish, unapologetically racist, explains that what annoys him about African Americans is their refusal to realize that they won't be given anything. Costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want.Costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, who is visibly unnerved by Costello. Costello warns him to have more money next time. Costello asks the shop owner's young teenage daughter behind the counter if she's got her period yet. His attitude is nonchalant and all the more threatening for it. The daughter is both affronted and compelled by the powerful Costello and answers his rhetorical question.

They pressure him to disqualify himself as an officer because he's too smart to be a cop and because of his family's ties to crime. When Costigan stands up to their hazing, they change tactics: they offer him a job as a police officer on one condition: that he quit the academy, serve serious time in jail on a trumped-up assault charge, and infiltrate Costello's organization. Only Queenan and Dignam will know that Costigan is working undercover.

Something unseen is chasing her. She approaches the house and tries to open a double door. It opens and she rushes in, closing it and an inner door which she latches shut. She looks around, picking up a letter opener and leaves the room. The door is forced open by the unseen force. She runs upstairs into her bedroom, bolting the door. The doorknob is rattled as the unseen tries to get in. The noise stops and there is silence. The girl cautiously approaches the door when suddenly the ghostly image of a girl (Betsy Bell) (Rachel Hurd-Wood) appears beside her. She screams and at that moment awakens from a dream, sitting up in bed in hysterics. She is comforted by her mother (Elizabeth Powell) (Susan Almgren) who tells her she had a bad dream again. She suggests a nice warm bath, which is rejected by Jane, saying maybe later. The mother tells her she must get ready to be picked up by her father (David Powell) (Howard Rosenstein) for the weekend. She acknowledges this. Elizabeth picks up some clothes from the floor, noticing a bundle of old things which she asks Jane about. Telling her mother they are from the attic, Jane is told you know the attic is off-limits. Jane apologizes and is told just dont do it again as the mother exits. Jane goes into a fetal position on her bed.Elizabeth goes into the study carrying the old doll and things from the attic. Pouring herself a drink from a vodka bottle, she looks painfully at a family photo that includes her, Jane and her ex-husband David. She picks up the doll (having a cracked face) and says to it I know how you feel. Picking up an envelope marked The truth of our family history, she removes the paper from it and begins reading November 1848. I had hoped no one would ever find cause to open this letter. If you have, I must assume that unexplainable or even supernatural events have begun to occur. The story of the Bell Witch has always been considered to be a tall tale. This is not so. Please read this journal with great care. Its contents may save your life.  At this point a flashback shows Betsy being chased by Joshua Gardner (Howard Rosenstein) who tries to kiss her after she falls on the ground. She tells him no. The other girl, Theny Thorn (Zoe Thorne) tells him leave that young lady alone. The two girls run off together giggling. Theny asks did he try to kiss you again?The Bell family home is shown in winter stating  Red River, Tennessee 1817. Lucy Bell (Sissy Spacek) brings in folded clothing as Betsy sits brushing her hair staring into the mirror. She tells her daughter that she should be nicer to Joshua. A woman should always keep a man on his toes, says Betsy. Isnt that what you taught me? I taught you no such thing, replies her mother. Lucy tells Betsy to lighten up on Joshua and to do her schoolwork.James Johnston (Matthew Marsh) and his wife arrive at a party at the Bell house. They enter into a room full of people as John Bell (Donald Sutherland) is telling a group of men about James and his experiences while drunk. He approaches them as John says speak of the devil. Theny prepares mistletoe on a stick to hang over the head of the teacher Richard Powell (James D'Arcy) so that Betsy can try to get a kiss from him. Her father John tells her it is inappropriate for a student to force her teacher into a compromising position. She insists that it is a Christmas tradition and that she is trying to learn the customs. Richard suggests a dance instead and they go off. James asks Lucy for a dance.Later that night Lucy is awakened by the sound of crying. Getting up, she notices John is not in bed. Lighting a candle, she goes to check on the boys, who are sound asleep. As she turns to go upstairs, John puts a hand on her shoulder, startling her. She tells him she heard noises from the roof. He tells her it comes from the attic and that it is not squirrels. This is not the first time they heard crying at night. He tells his wife you sleep so soundly, you never hear me get out of bed. She says yes I do and asks him what it was. He says its maybe the old witch trying to scare me off from the hearing tomorrow. Meanwhile something unseen opens the door to Betsys room and approaches her. Heavy breathing is heard, but Betsy appears to be asleep.The next day at the church a hearing is made between Kathe Batts (Gaye Brown) who some say is a witch and John Bell. The fighting is over some land which adjoins the Bell property. John tells the court he gave her $100 and the use of his slave in compensation. The judge (Vernon Dobtcheff) rules that the land is returned to Batts but the profit made from sale of the timber belongs to John.

Scoop,2006,96,Comedy,6.6,Woody Allen,Woody Allen,Hugh Jackman,Ian McShane,Nigel Lindsay,Geoff Bell,"\"We begin in a church, where a bold and fearless English journalist and reporter named Joe Strombel is being eulogized. Afterward, a group of his colleagues are in a bar, drinking and reminiscing, and they toast to Joe, wherever he is.Cut to the barge of the dead ferrying recently deceased to their destination. Aboard is Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), trying to bribe the ferryman. He strikes up a conversation with another deceased soul on the ferry, Jane Cook, now former secretary to Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), son of an English lord. Joe mentions that he died of a coronary thrombosis. Jane, however, believes she was murdered... by Lyman himself. Jane tells Joe hat she was getting suspicious that Lyman was in fact a serial killer known to English police as the Tarot Card killer. Joe wrote a case about these murders when they first began, and wonders why Jane suspects Lyman.Jane says that at the last murder, a cufflink was found-- an expensive Art Deco. Lyman had these exact cufflink models... and before Jane died, she noticed he'd lost one of them. Jane phoned her lawyer for advice on whether to report it, and heard a faint click on the phone line, as if someone had been listening in. Later that day, she'd had a cup of tea, and she died very suddenly shortly afterward, leading her to suspect that her tea had been poisoned. This fascinates Joe, and he's a little sad that he got the 'scoop' on Lyman, but now that he's dead, he can't tell the story to others.At the prestigious Dorchester Hotel, a film director named Tinsley is arriving, and at the door to his room is a young American journalism student named Sondra Pransky (Scarlet Johannsen). Pransky is very excited at meeting Tinsley in person and asks to interview him. Although tired and still busy, Tinsley agrees. But Pransky, young and still naive, doesn't get the interview because Tinsley gets her drunk, even seduces her, but her intoxication makes her fall asleep and when she wakes up, as she tells a close family friend later, he was on his way to Thailand. Although her friend, Vivian (Romola Garai), tries to console and reassure her, Pransky is still unhappy about blowing the story.Meanwhile, Joe Strombel has been moping about the death barge, and sits on the edge of the deck. When he's satisfied nobody is looking, he tips over into the River Styx, and swims away.Pransky goes with Vivian and her little brother to see a stage show. One of the acts in the show is a magician with the stage name, Splendini (Woody Allen). Splendini's act blends illusion with comedy, and he speaks obsequiously but the audience enjoys his performance.Splendini calls for a volunteer, and Pransky is selected from the audience to come on stage. After some small talk, Splendini puts Pransky into a prop box that he says will 'agitate her molecules and split them apart,' before he 'puts her back together.'The trick goes off without a hitch, except for Pransky: while she's in the box, oblivious to what's going on outside, Joe Strombel appears to her and tells her the scoop about the Tarot Card murder case, but he's only able to say Peter Lyman's name before he disappears, pulled back onto the ferry to meet his destiny. Meanwhile, Splendini opens the box to show Pransky standing inside, slowly waving her hand around the box's interior. She's at a loss for words as to what she saw, which Splendini and the audience mistake as awe at how the trick worked, and he sends her back to her seat to a round of applause.Later, in her room, Pransky googles the Tarot Card killer. She sees that he preys on prostitutes, and has recently claimed a tenth victim after going off the radar a year ago. He always strikes in different parts of London, and leaves a tarot card on his victims-- usually the Hangman card. She then googles Joe Strombel, reading about his distinguished career for a London newspaper and his fearlessness in pursuing a story.Pransky goes back to the stage show site and asks to speak to Splendini, whose real name is Sidney Waterman. Pransky tells him about a spirit appearing in the box while she was inside, which Waterman hears with skepticism. Pransky insists that there is, or rather was, a Joe Strombel, and she googled him, and read about how he died three days ago, and that he was a journalist, like she is a journalism student. She asks Waterman to put her back in the box, where she hopes she can re-establish contact.Waterman, perhaps a little reluctantly, puts Pransky back in the 'dematerializer' box, where she tries to talk to Strombel and convince him to tell her more about the story. But after several minutes, nothing happens, and the cynical Waterman tries to send Pransky on her way, thinking she's a little crazy.But just then, Strombel suddenly appears, asking Pransky to write down some details. Waterman stares in shocked amazement as he watches Strombel give Pransky details on the Tarot Card murder case, how all his victims were prostitutes with short brunette hair. Strombel tells Pransky that Lyman is a well-respected aristocrat with connections, meaning she can't go to the police without solid proof, because otherwise, he's above reproach; also, if he sniffs out any suspicion on him, he'll become impossible to trap. Strombel tells Pranskky that Lyman might have poisoned his own secretary because he suspected she was catching on to him. Pransky must pursue the story first, on her own, without police aid, and then break it only when she can prove the suspicion. Strombel tells Pransky that this story can change her life if she has the courage to pursue it, but she must be careful, because lives are in the balance, including her own. Looking nervous, Strombel says his time is up and he must go. Death appears and takes Strombel, disappearing right after.Pransky is determined to break the story, and she needs Waterman's help... exactly what Waterman is now too scared to give. He does small time card and coin tricks, and has no idea how to help a journalism student pursue a real, big-time story. He tries to convince Pransky to go to the police, only to realize what would happen to her if she accused a well-respected lord's son of being a serial killer, based on a lead from a dead man's spirit.Pransky is staking out a corporate skyscraper hoping to spot Lyman, even though she isn't certain what he looks like. But Pransky is sure it's Lyman who walks out of the building. He gets into a cab, and Pransky hurries to another waiting cab, in order to follow him.The cab drops Lyman off at an antiques gallery, and Waterman asks Pransky if she's satisfied that she's gotten a look at him... but just then they find out that the man isn't Lyman at all. Waterman takes Pransky outside and tells her that she should live her life without further embarrassments, and that he needs to go home.Pransky has coffee with Vivian, who tells her that she hears that Lyman swims at the governor's club; a posh, exclusive private gentleman's club. Vivian's father has a business partner who is a member, and members are allowed to bring guests in.Pransky rounds up Waterman again and takes him to the club. At the pool, they spot a man swimming by himself, and Pransky is unsure how to meet him. Waterman suggests she pretend to get a cramp in the pool and feign drowning, and if Lyman is the gentleman he's purported as, he'll come to her aid.Waterman goes to get coffee, and Pransky decided to try his plan. She gets into the pool and starts floundering and gasping in the water; her head going under a few times. Lyman hurries over and swims her to the edge so she can sit. Pransky thanks him fawningly, saying she wasn't a good swimmer and her leg cramped. Lyman notes he hasn't seen her face before and asks if she's a new member. Lyman knows Jack Fulton, the business partner of Vivian's father. Pransky decides to introduce herself as Jade Julliard Spence, part of a wealthy family from Palm Beach.Waterman's plan pays off as Lyman invites her to a garden party his father is throwing that weekend at his estate. Pransky is glad to accept, and as Waterman returns, Pransky introduces him as her father. Waterman isn't pleased about the idea and still thinks Pransky is taking too many wild chances, but still agrees to help her.Sunday comes, and Pransky and Waterman arrive at the Lyman estate for the garden party. Lyman introduces them to his father, Lord Lyman (Julian Glover), who notes their lack of social graces and hapless attempts to converse, but stays silent. He suggests that Lyman show Pransky and Waterman around the estate.While showing them around, Lyman makes further conversation and eventually Pransky takes one of the offered bones, asking if Lyman will show her how to fly fish. While they're on the lake, Waterman does a few card tricks for other guests and further bungles attempts at conversation, showing his ineptitude, but in a way that nobody catches on.Pransky makes further small talk as she walks through the gardens with Lyman and finally drops a hint by saying she's into New Age items, such as crystals and tarot. Lyman says he's more scientific minded, and given his background of privilege, it's seemed a given that he's destined to enter politiccs. When Pransky mentions she also likes to dance, Lyman offers to take her dancing. Pransky looks at Lyman with another fawning glance, and the chemistry and sparks of attraction between the two are clear.Lyman then says he'll have his new secretary send Pransky a list of Chinese restaurants, since she's said she likes Chinese food, and mentions his previous secretary, a young woman, died suddenly of a blood clot. When Pransky curiously asks if an autopsy was done to confirm this, Lyman skillfully and quickly changes the subject,During this time, Waterman is snooping around private rooms of the estate, including Lyman's bedroom. He finds an envelope of some kind in Lyman's bag, and carefully secretes it in an inside jacket pocket.Pransky continues to talk with Lyman and the two start to become infatuated with one another.One of Lyman's cars drops Pransky and Waterman off, and the two start to argue, at first, over Waterman's endless babble, and then over whether Lyman has killed anyone, which both of them believe he hasn't. When Pransky mentions that Lyman offered to take her dancing, Waterman describes this as a way of gathering clues, and then shows her one-- the envelope Waterman swiped from Lyman's overnight bag contains part of a name scrawled on it: Betty G. Pransky takes the news skeptically, saying this woman could be anyone.Waterman meets some of Lyman's associates for a poker game he's been invited to. Lyman arrives late due to having been bogged down at work, and Waterman is doing well, being a skilled player.Meanwhile, Pransky is discussing her infatuation with Lyman, with Vivian, downplaying it. She stops suddenly, seeing a newspaper sign saying that the Tarot killer has struck once more. Reading the article with Waterman, they see the murder victim was a short-haired brunette prostitute, just like all the previous ones, and the same tarot card, the Hangman, was left by her body. Lyman arrived at the poker game at a sufficient hour that Waterman believes would have given him plenty of time to kill the prostitute, if he did in fact commit the murder. Pransky knows she needs to dig deeper, despite her growing crush on Lyman; she needs to get a closer look at where he lives.Lyman shows Pransky around his house, away from the estate; tastefully decorated with several art works Pransky recognizes from her college studies. Downstairs, is a climate-controlled room with many rare musical instruments.Pransky calls the room romantic, and Lyman suddenly leans in and steals a kiss. Pransky smiles at him.Waterman is putting on another magic show as Splendini, and is putting another woman from the audience into his \"\"dematerializer\"\" box. When he opens the box to show that she's disappeared",Joe Strombel leans out and urgently tells Waterman in a hushed voice to remember the number sequence 16,21,12.

She explains that all the cancer patients which her cure has been tested on have recovered so far. The scene jumps to three years later. We see New York City has become an empty and desolate place, devoid of human life. Grass covers roads and buildings, abandoned cars line the highways and the city is silent. It seems that the apocalypse has arrived.Robert Neville (Will Smith) is driving through the deserted city accompanied by Sam, his dog. A herd of deer leap across his path and he follows them gives chase at speed in the car. He tries to shoot them and we realise it's a hunt. The deer split up and run down a road blocked with abandoned cars. Neville gives chase on foot, trying to hunt one deer down. As he rounds a corner he gets the deer in his gun sights only to be beaten to the kill by a lion that presumably escaped from the NYC zoo. Robert is torn as to whether to shoot the lion and its family who also enter the scene or leave the deer to them. At this point Robert's watch alarm starts beeping and he leaves, taking Sam with him. We see Neville's home. It is the typical American detached house, but it looks as though it were in the middle of a war zone. Robert and Sam have had a seemingly normal evening, eating processed food and watching tv. After a bath, Neville shuts, locks and protects every door and window with massive steel shutters. He sleeps with Sam in a bathtub, rifle in hand, with sounds of screaming surround the home.He dreams of how Zoe (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), his wife, their child, Marley (Willow Smith), and Sam, as a puppy, try to leave New York.

The dream scene is interrupted by Neville waking to once again face his lonely reality.At his fortress-like home, Robert exercises and goes down to the basement, where he keeps a small but hi-tech laboratory. We see that he has been experimenting with a vaccine for the virus that has wiped out most of the human race. He's tried the vaccine, evidently only one of hundreds, on some mice in order to find a viable cure. All the mice act incredibly aggressive, except for one. Robert makes note of this mouse and deems that specific compound ready for human trials.Later, Robert goes to a video-rental store where he talks to some mannequins he has set up, his only form of contact with the human form. It seems he has created a game for himself to prevent madness from taking him. He later visits some condo flats nearby, searching for supplies and coming upon a room with a bed surrounded by plastic wrap and another room with two cribs. We see the pain in his eyes as he empathises with the loss of loved ones. Later, we hear the radio message Neville has created and plays over all AM radio frequencies. It says that he's alive, and that he'll be waiting for more survivors at the docks of the bay at midday everyday.Sam spots a deer again, so Robert and Sam go after it. The deer runs into an old building at ground level, and Sam goes after it, although Robert has tried to hold Sam back. Robert enters the building as Sam will not return of his own accord. Carefully, Robert searches the darkened rooms. He finds the corpse of the deer and Sam, hiding under an old desk. An Infected male then leaps out of the darkness to attack Robert and is shot dead. Both Sam and Robert start running away through the building. Some more of the infected appear and chase them. He fights them all and both are able to get out of the building. The leader of the infected (Dash Mihok) cannot run after them because his skin burns as soon as he comes in contact with the sunlight, and after screaming at Neville, he retreats back to the safety of the darkness. Soon afterwards, Robert sets a trap to catch one of the infected. He succeeds and takes the captured female infected (Joanna Numata) home to his lab. He tries the vaccine that made the mouse less aggressive, but it fails and the woman flatlines. He revives her with an adrenaline shot and continues to adapt his serums in the hope of finding a cure.That night, he again dreams of the past, when his wife and child try tried to leave New York in the chaos of its evacuation. He relives the panic and terror on the streets as the citizens of the city try to escape before the infected take control.

He drives his car at speed into the hoards of infected who roam the streets at night. He crashes and the infected overpower the vehicle. Just as he is about to die a bright light shines on him and he blacks out. While blacked out, he has dreams about the past once more. This time he dreams of the helicopter his wife and child used to escape New York. As it takes off it, a nearby helicopter is attacked by infected and crashes into the helicopter carrying his family.He wakes up in a his house to Shrek playing on the TV and stitches in his knife wound. The people who rescued him are Anna (Alice Braga) and her son Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who have heard Robert's radio message and went to find him the previous day. Anna explains a plan to leave New York, and go to a colony of immune survivors in Vermont. Robert, however, insists that he wants to be left alone and that he doesn't believe that such a place exists.Later that evening, Robert realizes that the infected are attacking the house. The previous night they had followed Anna back when she rescued Robert. Although Robert's home defenses are comprehensive, the infected are so great in number they breach the shutters and make their way into the house. Robert, Anna and Ethan retreat to the basement lab.During the hectic fight, Robert has time to realize that the infected female he had captured earlier and tested the virus vaccine on, has come back to her human form. He takes a sample of her blood in a syringe and gives it to Anna, telling her to leave through a small trap-door with Ethan. Robert stays back to kill as many of the infected as he can, blowing them to pieces along with himself, including the vicious alpha-male who has made a personal quest out of hunting Robert down.Anna and Ethan reach a strange place in the middle of the countryside: the road is cut by a castle-like wall and a steel door. There, some human survivors live in that enclosed community. Anna gives the syringe with the antidote to the human leader of that small community and her voice over tells us of the legend that Robert Neville has become.Alternate Ending:During the fight between Robert and the Infected, Robert realizes that the infected female he had captured earlier and tested the virus vaccine on, has come back to her human form. Alpha vampire makes cracks in the glass chamber (in shape of a butterfly) indicating he wants the female back. Robert removes her drug drip and moves her outside the glass chamber, saying that he's listening (to God). The alpha vampire directs other vampires not to attack Robert, who now vaccinates the female to return her to vampire form. The alpha vampire picks her up and leaves with other vampires while Robert says sorry to them for killing some vampires in his experiments.Robert, Anna and Ethan now live together and keep on searching for other human survivors by sending messages in AM broadcasts.","suspenseful, neo noir, depressing, horror, flashback, action, revenge, sentimental",train,imdb

The Nativity Story,2006,101,Drama,6.8,Catherine Hardwicke,Mike Rich,Oscar Isaac,Nadim Sawalha,Ciarán Hinds,Alexander Siddig,"This is a conflation of the stories of the birth of Jesus found in biblical accounts by Matthew and Luke.Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives in the small town of Nazareth. She's still young enough to play with the other children of the town, although she must also work to help her poor family get by. The people of the town can barely pay the king's taxes. When one of their neighbors loses his daughter to involuntary servitude to pay off a tax debt, Mary is forced into a betrothal by her parents to Joseph (Oscar Isaac), a young homebuilder who has had his eye on Mary. They're told they must not consummate the marriage for a year. Mary's not happy with the arrangement. She barely knows Joseph; she certainly does not love him.But then an angel (Alexander Siddig) appears to Mary, telling her she's been chosen by God to bear the Son of God, who will save their people. She's told her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo), who's ostensibly too old to have children, is already pregnant, which is proof God can do anything. Mary agrees to the angel's request, and then travels to see Elizabeth. Elizabeth is the wife of Zechariah (Stanley Townsend), a priest who was told in the temple his aged wife would conceive and bear a son, who was to be named John. Zechariah didn't believe it, so he lost his ability to speak. When Mary shows up, Elizabeth seems to know all about Mary's impending pregnancy, saying her own child leapt in her womb. Mary tells Elizabeth she's scared, since the law requires she remain pure. She thinks nobody will believe she's kept her vows. Elizabeth comforts her, telling her to trust God.Mary stays until Elizabeth's child is born. Zechariah gets his voice back when he insists the boy be named John. Mary, who is now pregnant, decides she had better return home.When she comes back noticeably pregnant, however, the whole town is scandalized, and Joseph is broken hearted. Mary's parents can't believe Mary; they fear she might have been raped by one of Herod's soldiers. They tell her she could be put to death for violating her vows. Joseph agrees not to press charges, but he's upset and bitter. The town shuns Mary. But then Joseph sees the same angel in a dream who tells him Mary's telling the truth, and so he takes her back, which now makes him an outcast in the town, too.Meanwhile, evil King Herod (Ciarán Hinds) is worried about a prophecy of a new king who will be a Messiah for his people. He thinks some usurper may make political use of the prophecy to start an uprising. He decides to take advantage of Caesar's desire for a census to make everyone return to his ancestral home. Since the Messiah is to come from David's lineage, Herod thinks he can trap the pretender in Bethlehem, the City of David. Joseph is a descendant of David, so Herod's order also forces Joseph to go to Bethlehem. Mary agrees to go with him, so they undertake an arduous journey, during which Mary comes to see Joseph as a good, self-sacrificing man. Affection and trust grows between them.At about the same time, three magi in Persia, who have also been studying prophecy, decide to travel to Judea because the alignment of a star with two planets tells them a new king will be born there. They load up some camels and take off across the desert. At a stopover in Jerusalem, they tell Herod the Messiah king will not be a grown man, but a little baby. Herod pretends he wants to pay homage to the new king, too, and asks them to return with directions once they've located him. After they leave, Herod hatches a terrible idea. He decides he can put an end to the people's hope in the prophecy by killing all the babies in Bethlehem.Just as Mary and Joseph reach Bethlehem, Mary starts contractions. Joseph runs around looking for a place for her delivery, but all that's offered is a stable. Just as she gives birth, the three celestial bodies line up, and a shaft of light falls on the stable. Following the advice of the angel, some shepherds show up to see, including one who showed kindness to Mary and Joseph earlier. Mary tells him her baby is born for all mankind. The shepherds are followed by the magi. The magi present their gifts of gold for the king of kings, frankincense for the priest of priests, and myrrh for the one who must sacrifice.After they leave, Mary and Joseph go to sleep, but then Herod's soldiers begin their terrible infanticide. Just in the nick of time, the angel's voice warns Joseph. So, as the soldiers start slaughtering the innocents, Joseph, Mary, and the baby Jesus are already out of town, heading for Egypt.","murder, whimsical, flashback, good versus evil, melodrama, storytelling",train,imdb

The target was interrogator and torturer Abasi, but he is unharmed.Egyptian-born Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer who lives in Chicago with his pregnant wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) and their young son, is linked to a violent organization by telephone records indicating known terrorist Rashid placed several calls to Anwar's cell phone. While returning to the US from a conference in South Africa, he is detained by American officials and sent to a secret detention facility near the location of the suicide attack depicted earlier. Isabella is not informed and, growing worried, travels to Washington and slowly pieces together details of Anwar's detention.For lack of more experienced staff, Freeman is assigned the task of observing the interrogation of Anwar by Abasi Fawal (Igal Naor). After Freeman briefly questions and tortures Anwar himself, he is convinced of Anwar's innocence. However, his boss insists that the detention continues, justifying such treatments as necessary to save thousands from becoming victims of terrorism. Eventually Anwar confesses to having advised on how to make more powerful bombs, and to have been promised $40,000 in return. However, Freeman believes it is a false confession, which is confirmed when he Googles the names Anwar gives as Rashid's aides and finds out that they are the names of the Egyptian football team from the year Anwar left Egypt. He also expresses doubt as to whether Anwar would be willing to put his life, family and job in danger for $40,000 when he earns $200,000 in his job.

But Fatima finds out from the photos that Khalid's brother met his death at the hands of her father, and realizes what Khalid is planning. At the town square Fatima begs him not to do it, arguing that the target is her father. After removing the pin of his detonator he hesitates, and is therefore killed by the organizers of the attack. As a result he releases the handle of the detonator, and the bomb explodes, killing Fatima also.The record of a phone call supposedly made by Rashid to Anwar is not explained in the film. However, earlier it was mentioned that phones are sometimes passed on from one person to another, yet despite this reasonable doubt the CIA officials refused to release him. It turned out that in South Africa, while Anwar's phone was off, there had been a call to it from an unknown person.For the scenes of Abasi's private life it is not always clear to which storyline they belong, that before or after the explosion. Abasi learns about Fatima's death only a week later.","romantic, violence, murder, sadist, flashback",train,imdb

Up,2009,96,Comedy,8.3,Pete Docter,Pete Docter,Edward Asner,Bob Peterson,Bob Peterson,Jeremy Leary,"Young Carl Fredricksen (Jeremy Leary), a quiet bespectacled boy wearing an old pilot's cap and goggles, watches a film reel in a theater depicting his hero Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), a famous explorer. The reporter speaks of Muntz's various accomplishments and discoveries before commenting that he was recently dishonored by scientists who believed his latest find, the large skeleton of a bird, was a hoax. Intent on proving them wrong, Muntz is seen boarding his zeppelin with his team of dogs and promises to return once he has brought back living proof of his find. After the show, Carl runs down the street with his balloon, named after Muntzs zeppelin The Spirit of Adventure. He passes an old, rundown house where he hears someone shout out Muntz's famous slogan: Adventure is out there!Carl goes inside to investigate and meets a young, outgoing tomboy who shares his passion for exploration and admiration of Charles Muntz. Startled by her loud, boyish demeanor at first, Carl loses his balloon in the rafters. The girl, Ellie (Elie Docter), helps him retrieve it, though Carl falls from a beam and breaks his arm. Ellie sneaks into his room that night and shows him her adventure book where she expresses a desire to one day move to the top of Paradise Falls in South America, showing him a picture that she 'ripped right out of a library book'. She makes him promise that they will go together someday before leaving. A musical montage shows Carl and Ellie eventually getting married and moving into the old house where they first met. Their marriage is blissful and they get jobs as a balloon salesman and zookeeper, respectively. When they discover that Ellie is unable to have children, they make a pact to save money to travel to Paradise Falls. However, as the years pass, they are forced to dig into their Falls fund for other obligations. One day, an elderly Carl realizes that, despite living happily together, they never fulfilled their old promise and decides to surprise Ellie on a picnic with tickets to South America. However, Ellie's declining health puts her in the hospital and she eventually passes away, leaving Carl alone.Carl remains in his home, a retired and sour recluse, as the city grows around him. He is encouraged to move to a retirement home due to increased construction, but often argues with the foreman (John Ratzenberger) and refuses to leave. One day, he meets Russell (Jordan Nagai), a young wilderness explorer scout who attempts to assist Carl in order to earn his 'assisting the elderly' badge. Carl tricks Russell into 'assisting' him by telling him to find and get rid of a 'snipe' that invades his yard. When a construction worker accidentally breaks Carl's mailbox, a part of the house and a part of Ellie that Carl cherishes, Carl hits him over the head with his walker. The assault lands him in court where he is forced to move out of his home by the next day. Workers from Shady Oaks retirement home arrive to pick him up the following morning but are shocked to find Carl releasing millions of helium balloons into the air which detach his house from its foundation, lifting it over the city and into the sky.Comfortably away from the city, Carl sets a course for South America and rests in his chair until hes interrupted by a knock at the door. Upon answering, he discovers Russell hanging on to dear life on his porch; apparently, Russell had been snipe searching under Carls porch. Carl lets him in and decides to descend to return Russell home before a severe storm hits. The house is knocked around in the turbulence but Carl manages to tie most of his items down before falling asleep. He's woken the next morning by Russell, who tells him that they're over South America (thanks to a GPS device that he accidentally throws out the window), though the ground is hidden by a dense fog. Carl releases some balloons to descend but they hit ground early and are knocked out of the house. They manage to hold onto it using a hose attached to the porch while the fog lifts to reveal that they are standing on a high plateau opposite Paradise Falls. Unable to climb back into the house, they resolve to walk to the falls before the helium in the balloons lets out.Meanwhile, a chase is progressing in the jungle. Three dogs with red lights on their collars are in hot pursuit of what appears to be a giant bird, but they lose the trail when their sensitive ears pick up the fine tuning of Carl's hearing aid. Russell stops to go to the bathroom and happens upon a giant bird which he lures closer with a chocolate bar. He introduces the colorful creature to Carl and gives it the name Kevin. Kevin follows them as they continue their journey but runs off when they approach the silhouette of a man who calls out to them. However, they see that the man is nothing more than a trick of the eye caused by overlapping stones. They are then approached by a golden retriever with a red light on his collar. Russell tells him to sit and speak and is surprised when the dog answers, using the device on his collar. He tells them his name is Dug (Bob Peterson) and that he is a tracker looking for a bird, at which point Kevin tackles him. The foursome continue their journey, Carl begrudging the additional company. At one point, Kevin loudly calls out and is answered by smaller calls. Dug says that Kevin is calling to her babies and Russell realizes that Kevin is a girl.Meanwhile, the three dogs seen chasing the bird earlier have picked up the scent of Carl and Russell, who they nickname the mailman. The leader Alpha (Bob Peterson), a doberman pinscher, tells Beta (Delroy Lindo), a rottweiler, and Gamma (Jerome Ranft), a bulldog, that they must be vigilant and continue their search. His speaking device appears to be damaged, causing him to talk in a high pitch. Using the device on Gamma's collar, Alpha calls to Dug, who they'd sent on a false mission in order to get rid of him, but finds him in the company of the bird they'd been after. They soon track him down and come upon Carl and Russell, but Kevin has already run off. Instead, they choose to take Carl and Russell to their master. Entering a large gorge, Carl and Russell meet a large pack of dogs, all with high-tech collars on, before meeting their master -- who turns out to be none other than an elderly Charles Muntz.Muntz invites them into The Spirit of Adventure as guests, but his behavior soon turns hostile when he finds out that Russell has adopted a new pet bird. Carl is shocked to see that Muntz has spent all the past years hunting for the bird which he was deemed a fraud for and has gone mad as a result. Muntz reveals a table of head mannequins wearing various headgear and grimly knocks each one off with his cane as he describes the stories their wearers told him; claiming that each one was actually after his bird. Carl and Russell run away from the zeppelin just as Muntz discovers the bird calling out from the roof of Carl's home. Riding on Kevin's back and assisted by Dug, who calls Carl his new master, they barely escape capture by Muntz's dogs, though Kevin is injured in the process. Carl agrees to help Kevin get back to her babies safely but, just before Kevin can re-enter her labyrinth home, a net flies out and captures her. Muntz and his dogs have arrived in the zeppelin, led to the spot by a tracking device on Dug's collar. Muntz throws a lantern beneath Carl's home, setting fire to it. Carl ignores Kevin and runs over to extinguish the flames as Muntz takes Kevin on board and leaves. Angry and disheartened, Carl yells at Dug and tells Russell that he's taking his home to Paradise Falls if it kills him. He manages to set his house down on the Falls, but loses Russell's respect for leaving Kevin.Carl goes inside the house and sits down to look at Ellie's adventure book. Saddened that she never got to see the Falls, he is about to close it when he discovers added pictures near the end, documenting their life together. On the last page is a note written by Ellie that says thanks for the adventure, now go have a new one! Enlightened and inspired, Carl goes outside in time to see Russell take off with a few balloons, using a leaf blower as propulsion. Carl empties his home of extra furniture, allowing it to become airborne once again, and follows Russell. He finds Dug on his porch and happily exclaims that Dug is his dog and he is his master. Russell manages to sneak aboard Muntz's zeppelin but is quickly caught and tied to a chair. Muntz sits him on the ships bomb-bay doors and flips the switch for them to open. Carl flies in and manages to rescue Russell in time, setting him inside the house while he goes into the zeppelin with Dug to fetch Kevin. Hes able to distract the guard dogs with a tennis ball from his walker and frees Kevin but is confronted by Muntz. They engage in a sword fight (albeit Carl uses his extended walker) while Russell, freed of his ties, fights off a squadron of dogs in fighter planes. He regains control of the house and returns to help Carl, who has climbed to the top of the zeppelin with Kevin. Dug has, meanwhile, faced off against Alpha and outsmarted him, effectively becoming the new alpha, and runs off to meet the others topside.Kevin, Dug, and Carl run for the house which Russell has landed on the wing of the zeppelin, but Muntz appears with a rifle and shoots at them, causing the house to slip and dangle in the air. Carl struggles to hold onto the house with the hose while Muntz goes in after Kevin. Carl lures Kevin, carrying Dug and Russell, out of the house with chocolate and Muntz attempts to jump out of the window after them. He doesn't make the jump as his foot gets caught in some balloon strings and, weighing too much for the balloons to support him, he falls to his death. As Kevin, Dug, and Russell make it back to the zeppelin, Carl is forced to release his house, which slowly descends into the clouds, a loss which Carl accepts as being for the best.Kevin is returned to her three chicks and Carl takes Russell and Dug home where Russell attends his senior explorer ceremony. When Russell's father fails to present him with his final badge, Carl fulfills the role and gives Russell a grape soda badge that Ellie gave him when they first met, calling it the Ellie badge. Afterwards, they sit on a curb together in front of an ice cream shop, Carl acting as a surrogate grandfather to Russell, The Spirit of Adventure anchored above them.At Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie's house has landed right at the spot where it was meant to be: on the cliff overlooking the falls.","comedy, boring, depressing, dramatic, feel-good, tragedy, romantic, entertaining, storytelling, sentimental",val,imdb

Next to the river, theres a quiet, empty cabin. Each room of the cabin is silent and still. A man (Shane West) in a white long sleeve shirt is standing silently staring out a window. Theres a dock to the river outside the cabin. The man is then at the kitchen table, staring silently outside. Music on an old record player is playing while the man is sitting in the living room in the dark.In the morning, the man is staring out the window. Theres a storm outside. A crash of thunder and a loud bang sound throughout the empty cabin. The bang catches the mans attention. The front door is open and he stares at it. The door behind him flings open and a figure in a rain poncho walks through the living room. Its a woman (Mira Sorvino). She doesnt see the man because he is a Ghost. She hangs up her raincoat in a closet and closes the door. She then opens the door again and steps back. The door closes on its own and The Woman smiles. The Ghost is standing in the corner of the room watching her with a furrowed brow. She walks through the house with her bags and goes into a bedroom and starts to unpack. She looks at old black and white photos sitting on a dresser. She then goes to the kitchen and lights a gas lantern. She pumps water into the sink, fills a kettle, and puts it on the wood burning stove. She starts to unpack some groceries and reaches into a high cupboard and pulls out a bottle of alcohol that she knew was there. She smiles, uncorks it, smells it smiling, and sets it on the counter. She then notices a coffee mug on the kitchen table, picks it up, and blows dust off it. The tea kettle whistles. We see a meadow at sunset. The Woman is at the kitchen table with a lantern having dinner and a glass of wine. She finishes her meal and takes her dishes to the sink. Through the kitchen window, we see the Ghost slowly appear behind her, watching her with a furrowed brow.In the morning, theres a rainbow over the river. The Woman leaves the cabin and takes a motorboat down the river. We next see her back at the cabin. Shes walking outside and we see the Ghost standing at a window watching her. She goes to an outhouse in the woods. She looks at the outhouse and pauses. She picks up a stick and goes in the outhouse. We hear banging from inside the outhouse and then silence. A bird then flies into the side of the outhouse and dies. The Woman comes out slowly with the stick, looks around the side, and sees the dead bird. She kneels and touches it gently. We then see the Ghost looking out the window, watching her as she digs a small hole and places the bird gently in the grave. He looks less angry as he watches her.Its nighttime and The Woman is sitting in the living room listening to a record. The windup record player slowly stops playing. The Ghost is sitting across from her watching her. She puts out the fire and takes the lantern upstairs. The Woman gets in bed and blows out the lantern. The record then suddenly starts playing on its own. The Woman relights the lantern and slowly walks downstairs. She goes into the living room. The Ghost is sitting by the record player. She shuts off the record and goes back to bed.In the morning, The Woman is arranging books on the table and opens a notebook to start writing when she hears a boat. The Ghost is standing in the doorway. She stands to look outside and sees a boat coming towards the dock. The Ghost and The Woman each stand at a window and watch the approaching boat. The Woman heads downstairs and walks down the dock. An old man (Muse Watson) gets out of the boat with a box of groceries while a young man in a black hooded sweater (Adam Croce) waits in the boat. The Woman asks Mr. Browman if he would like some coffee, but he declines and says he needs to get back to the store. He asks her if shes okay in the cabin. She happily says she is. He says hed be scared to be there and she says shell be fine. He says its creepy and she insists shell be fine. He says okay and then tells her he brought her some fresh chickens and tells her to keep them in the shed because the weather is cold enough to make the shed like a refrigerator. She thanks him. The Ghost in the house watches as the storeowner gets back in the boat and leaves. We next see The Woman taking the chickens out to the shed. She walks in and leaves the door open. A shadow forms on the wall outside of the shed and the door slams shut startling The Woman. She goes to the door and looks out the window as the shadow recedes. She tries to open the door but struggles with it for a few moments before it opens. She steps out panting and nervous.The woods and river are quiet as it starts to rain. The Woman is inside and notices a bookcase open. She shuts it and starts to walk away when she kicks a book that somehow ended up on the floor in the middle of the room. She picks it up and looks back at the case wondering how it got there. She opens the book The Complete Outdoorsmans Handbook and flips through the pages. In the book is an old newspaper clipping. She pulls it out and reads the headline Escaped Criminal Drowns: Man accused of murder found dead in Piken Lake. She puts the clipping back in the book.We next see The Woman that night lying in bed biting her fingernail. The Ghost is in the bedroom watching her as she blows out the lantern. The next morning, The Woman is startled awake and opens her eyes quickly. The Ghost is lying next to her staring her in the face. She quickly gets out of bed and looks around the room. The Ghost, still lying on the bed, watches her. She gets dressed and leaves the room. She sits at the kitchen table with a steaming mug, then goes into the living room and gets her cell phone from her purse. She takes it outside and makes a call asking for Mr. Browman. He isnt there, but she leaves a message that shes just checking in. She goes back in the cabin and puts her phone back in the purse. She then leaves the cabin wearing a heavy coat. The Ghost is standing at the door and looks as though he wants to follow her but cant. She walks through the dense woods and goes to the outhouse, again taking a stick in with her. We hear banging and then silence. Once again, a bird flies into the side of the outhouse and dies.The Ghost is looking out a window at a storm when the record player starts. He is then in the living room looking at the record player with a furrowed brow. Behind him, The Woman is also staring at the record player looking nervous. Neither of them turned it on. The front door then bangs open startling The Woman. A man (Justin Kirk) walks in and she hugs him. The Man is happy to see that she isnt angry at him for coming unannounced. The record player slowly stops playing. The Woman takes his coat and The Man tells her that Mr. Browman brought him to the island. The Man comments that Mr. Browman told him that there had been a storm the day shed arrived to the island as well. He looks around the cabin and asks her about the summers shed spent there as a child. He asks her to show him around and then points out the record player. She brushes it off and takes the record off the turntable. She suggests they unpack his bags and he says theres no hurry and says she can show him around first. He asks her if shes okay and she nods. They hug and The Man tells The Woman that hes missed her. Then he whispers in her ear and she laughs. They lie down on the couch and hold each other and laugh. The Ghost is upstairs listening to them.Later that day, the storm stops and The Woman shows The Man around the cabin. She takes him into her bedroom and tells him he can unpack. She tells him about her childhood summers at the cabin with her family. She talks about playing hide-and-seek and tells him she had the best hiding place on the entire island and offers to show it to him sometime. He pulls out a bottle of wine from his bag and she says theyll have it with dinner. They kiss and then The Man notices the black and white pictures on the dresser and asks if the people are her grandparents. She says yes and The Man comments that her grandmother was beautiful. The Woman says that her grandmother meant the world to her and tells The Man that her grandfather bought the cabin because her grandmother wanted it and that her grandfather hardly ever came to the cabin. The Man comments that she never talks about her grandfather. The Woman says that there isnt a need to because he wasnt a good guy. The Man asks, Like your dad? The Woman considers for a moment and says, Sure. She turns and walks away.That night, over dinner, The Man is telling The Woman about a party shed missed and says he wished shed been there. She says she needed to be at the cabin. He says he just likes having her around, and The Woman says that hell get a lot of her at the cabin. He says he hopes that it was okay that he came to the island.That night, in the dark, The Man wakes up The Woman and says he needs to go to the bathroom. She jokingly says, I told you to go before we went to bed, young man. She lights the lantern and gives it to him telling him to pee off the porch. He says thats not what he needs to do. She gives him directions to follow the path to the outhouse and he asks if shell walk him out there. She smiles at him and closes her eyes. He gets out of bed and the Ghost is standing next to the bed watching them. Before The Man leaves, The Woman tells him to use a stick to get rid of the spiders on the seat. The Man follows the path, sees the outhouse, and says, Youve got to be kidding me. He picks up a stick and goes inside. He closes the door and bangs the stick around the seat multiple times. He sits down to relieve himself and the lantern falls and breaks leaving him in the dark. Then the outhouse starts to shake and bang. He runs from the outhouse as a dense fog begins to roll in. He gets back in bed and wraps his arms around The Woman. She asks if it went okay but he doesnt answer.The next morning, The Woman takes The Man to see her favorite hiding spot. She shows him the small window that leads to the crawl space under the house. She says she sometimes used to go in there even when they werent playing hide-and-seek and that it was a good place to be alone. He seems surprised and asks if she got scared down there. She says no, that it stayed cool in there during the summer and she enjoyed listening to her grandmother move around the kitchen. The Woman says she felt safe there. She then asks The Man about his visit to the outhouse the night before. He sighs and shakes his head and she asks if he was scared. He says, Cmon, youve seen that place. She agrees and says thats why she doesnt go there in the dark. The Man says it wouldnt have been so bad if it hadnt been for all the banging. The Woman looks startled. The Man says it was from tree branches banging against the walls from the wind.They go for a walk around the island. The Woman shows The Man a great view from a cliff and tells him its another of her secret places. He says its beautiful and then says shes beautiful. He tells her that their 3 years together have been the best of his life. He says that he knows she has doubts and he understands why, but he doesnt have any doubts. He says he wants to spend his life with her and start a family with her. He pulls a ring box from his pocket and asks her to marry him. She pauses and looks unsure. He says hes not like the men from her family, he knows that its hard for her to believe that hes a good man, and he assures her that she can trust him and have faith in him. She doesnt respond, so he closes the ring box, takes her hand, gives it to her, and asks her to think about it. They hug for a moment and then suddenly theres a whisper and the edge of the cliff gives way beneath his feet. The Man falls over the edge, but The Woman grabs his arms and helps him back onto the cliff. They lie down next to each other panting and then start to laugh. She tells him she loves him and then says shell marry him. They kiss and he asks if anybody has made love on the cliff before. The Woman laughs and then sits up in a panic looking for the ring. Shed had it in her hand when The Man fell and she doesnt know where it went. After an unsuccessful search, they go back to the cabin. She apologizes for losing the ring and The Man says its okay, she was saving his life. He hugs her and she apologizes again.Later that day, The Man is taking a nap and The Woman is outside on a bench with a book in her lap. The Ghost is in the bedroom watching The Man sleep when he hears whispering. The Ghost is then in the living room looking out the window where The Woman is now asleep on the bench. The Ghost doesnt know where the whispering is coming from. A little later, The Man wakes up from his nap and calls for his girlfriend. He finds her outside on the bench reading and comments that its cold outside. The Woman aloofly replies that shes fine. The Man asks her why she didnt wake him up and she responds without looking at him that she thought he needed sleep. The Man asks if theyre going to eat and The Woman responds that shes going to keep working and she still doesnt look at him. The Man asks if shell help him light the stove since he hasnt done it before. The Woman finally looks at him and says coldly, If you want to be here, you have to take care of yourself. Its not that hard. The Man looks hurt and goes back inside. In the kitchen, hes preparing to light the stove when The Woman comes in and helps him.The next morning, The Woman brings a mug to The Man in bed and says its a peace offering and apologizes for her behavior the night before. The Man tells her its okay and offers to leave so she can do her work alone, saying he can go when the storeowner comes back to the island. She says no and tells him shes glad hes there. In the kitchen, The Man is helping The Woman with the dishes. She thanks him for helping and he jokes that hed make a good wife. The Woman laughs. The Man says hes going to go explore the island and leave her to her work, and that hell make dinner when he gets back. He jokes that the stove might get the best of him and The Woman asks if hed like her help lighting it. The Man says no and tells her that hes watched her do it and he can figure it out. He leaves to explore the island and walks past the Ghost whos standing in the corner with his fists clenched and his brow furrowed.When The Man comes back from his walk, he has wildflowers for The Woman. She smiles and he asks her about her day. She says shes having trouble getting focused and asks him about his walk. He says he took the worlds longest hike and comments that the island is a lot bigger than he thought. He tells her that hes about to start dinner and jokingly says that it will be ready in about five hours. She thanks him for the flowers and he goes downstairs.The Ghost is watching The Man in the kitchen making dinner when he hears the whispering again. He looks around him and then looks up to the ceiling when he realizes the whispering is coming from upstairs. The Ghost walks up the stairs and peers around the corner to see a man in a black suit (Tony Curran) kneeling beside The Woman whispering in her ear. Only bits of what hes saying can be heard: What hell do to you disgusting it makes you sick, doesnt it? It makes me sick too. The Woman looks upset as shes working. As The Man in Black is speaking, he turns and looks at the Ghost smiling maliciously. The Ghost steps back into the hallway. The whispering stops and the Ghost peers back into the room. The Woman is alone. When the Ghost steps back into the hall, The Man in Black is behind him and quietly says, Boo. When the Ghost spins around, The Man in Black is not there. The Ghost looks frightened.That evening, The Man goes upstairs and enthusiastically tells the Woman that dinner is ready. She doesnt look up. The Man tells her that he made spaghetti and he thinks its pretty good. The Woman stonily tells him that shes going to keep working. The Man laughs uncomfortably and starts to object. The Woman says that she has to keep working and thats why she came to the cabin. The Man says, Right, I just thought and The Woman cuts him off and cruelly says, Its not fair of you to keep asking me to spend time with you when I didnt even want you here. The Man asks her what happened. She yells at him to just leave her alone. The Man is hurt and walks back downstairs alone. Later that night, The Man is awake in bed when The Woman gets in bed. Their backs are to each other and neither speaks. The Ghost is in the room facing the window but looking at them over his shoulder.The next morning, The Man takes a mug outside to The Woman who is sitting on the bench. He offers her the coffee and she doesnt look at him. He sits next to her and gives her the mug. He says he did alright with the coffee and that hes getting pretty good in the kitchen. She doesnt drink the coffee. The Man puts his hand on her knee and she moves away and quickly stands up saying she needs to get started on her work. She goes inside, leaving The Man alone on the bench, and walks past the Ghost who is in the living room looking out the window.Suddenly The Man in Black is behind the Ghost. The Man in Black says, See how easy it can be?\"\" The Man in Black tell the Ghost that it wouldn't take much for The Woman to be his. The Ghost looks away from him.

Partir,2009,85,Drama,6.3,Catherine Corsini,Catherine Corsini,Alexandre Vidal,Yvan Attal,Gérard Lartigau,Sergi López,"\"There have been so many variations on D.H. Lawrences Lady Chatterley's Lover over the past eighty years that it has become almost a genre of its own. Few, however, have been as successful in elucidating Lawrence's theme of the psychic need to integrate mind and body into a single life force as Catherine Corsini's Leaving.Suzanne (Kristin Scott-Thomas) is an English woman who tries to leave her French husband Samuel (Yvan Attal) after becoming sexually involved with Spaniard Ivan (Sergi Lopez) an ex-convict who has been hired to build an office for her physiotherapy business in the back yard of their bourgeois estate. Samuel uses every means at his disposal , from cutting off her finances to threatening prison for her lover, to keep her in the house, until she finds but one means of exit.It is to both Corsini and Scott-Thomas's credit that such a stale premise has resulted in a movie that succeeds so well as both a celebration of erotic self-discovery and denunciation of patriarchal power structures. Corsini is lean and precise in both her script and direction. The first kiss between the lovers is seen in long shot from an obscure angle that makes the viewer question if anything really happened. Then Corsini cuts to a shot of them in a car, and we expect but do not receive a dialogue concerning the kiss, after which Suzanne is shown in bed with her husband, reading because of an apparent inability to sleep.Scott-Thomas gives a performance of exacting physicality. In the beginning, she is all limbs and no center, observing her own body with curious amusement. Her first tryst with Ivan is accomplished through an almost paralytic clinging, as if she is a dead battery charging itself. Before attaining the perfect harmony of body and mind, there is an interim transformation during which her husband accurately if disparagingly describes her as a bitch in heat.Samuel's fury at his wife's defection explodes with the incredulous rage of a factory owner whose workers have gone on strike. \"\"You are my wife!\"\" he insists",reducing her to a possession without a personal identity. All the rules of civility between human beings are forgotten in the ensuing battle between the former partners in a now ruptured marriage.In transgressing the boundaries of class as well as the limits of sexual fidelity,Suzanne loses her bourgeois privileges and becomes subject to the economic harassment of the those controlling the chains of finance,from the banks to the justice system. In the end

The two decide to take a walk on the frozen lake nearby. While walking, Ingrid notices some footprints.

Jack kills the shooter and then tells Ingrid to return to the cabin and phone the police while he searches the body. As she rushes past him, he shoots her in the back of the head. Jack suspects there may be another shooter and goes in search of him. He comes up behind another armed man and kills him.Jack travels to Rome, Italy where he contacts a man named Pavel (Johan Leysen). Pavel is the person who provides Jack with his assignments. They don't typically meet in person. Pavel insists that Jack cannot stay in Rome and sends him to Castelvecchio, a small town in the mountains of Abruzzo. Jack arrives in Castelvecchio and immediately feels uncomfortable, so he drives down the road to, Castel del Monte, throwing the phone Pavel had given him out of the car window on the way.While he is hiding out in Castel del Monte, Jack is befriended by an elderly priest, Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli), who senses that Jack is not who he claims to be and is struggling to find his way. The father pressures Jack to seek absolution, something which Jack, now going by the name 'Edward' and posing as a photographer, resists.Jack contacts Pavel, who offers him another job, a job that won't require him to kill anyone. Jack eventually decides to take the job and meets with a shady Belgian, named Mathilde (Thekla Reuten), who wants him to build a compact gun with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the accuracy of a rifle. Jack begins work on the weapon as he begins patronizing a local prostitute, named Clara (Violante Placido). At the same time, Jack realizes that he is being followed by a young Swedish man (Samuli Vauramo) who is probably associated with the people who tried to kill him at Dalarna.One day, Jack meets with Mathilde to test the weapon he has made in the nearby forest. She asks for a few more alterations to it, as well as some special ammunition.While having coffee one day, Clara and a friend, named Anna (Anna Foglietta), see him and come inside to say hello. Clara invites Jack on an actual date, and the two begin to deepen their relationship.One night, as the Swedish assassin follows him, Jack manages to get himself into position for an ambush, but just when he is about to shoot the man from behind, one of his neighbors who rides a Vesta scooter, comes speeding along, alerting the assassin who fires, missing Jack but killing the man on the scooter. Jack takes the scooter and chases after the Swede, who has jumped into his car and sped off. Jack shoots at the Swede, breaking out the back window of the car, then a front tire. The car crashes. Jack has to lay down the scooter to avoid crashing into the car, then gets up and runs to the driver's window, smashing it out with his elbow. He reaches in and grabs the Swede, pulling him partway out of the window, then twisting and breaking his neck.The next day, Jack encounters Father Benedetto while out walking. The father suspects that Jack was involved in the deaths that occurred the previous day and again offers himself to receive Jack's confession. Jack responds by observing that all men have sins, even Father Benedetto, and makes it clear that he has figured out that Father Benedetto fathered an illegitimate son, named Fabio, who works as a mechanic and also gets involved in illegal activities locally. Jack makes use of Fabio to acquire some items he needs to construct a suppressor for the weapon he's building for Mathilde.Jack begins to become suspicious of Clara after he looks through her purse and finds a small pistol. He also follows her and sees her meeting with some rough looking men. He takes her on a picnic where he's prepared to kill her if need be, but when she doesn't make an attempt, he decides instead to confront her about the gun in her purse. Clara explains that she has the gun because of a number of assaults on prostitutes which have occurred in the area. She further explains that the men she was talking to were cops investigating the case.After talking to Pavel one last time, Jack agrees to deliver the weapon to Mathilde, but tells Pavel it will be his last job. That doesn't seem to sit well with Pavel. At the drop off, Jack is on alert, suspicious that Mathilde may try to kill him after she takes the briefcase and excuses herself to go to the ladies room. Mathilde does prepare her pistol inside the ladies room and returns to meet Jack outside the restaurant. They appear about to engage in an old west shootout, but before anything can happen, a busload of students arrive and the kids run between them.

Pavel orders her to find one. She follows Jack back to town.Jack meets Clara in the crowd at a local religious festival. He asks her to go away with him and she joyfully agrees.

Ben is then told even more dire and stunning news: He moved to Antwerp eight weeks ago, but the last registered address for him before that was in New York... 14 years past. Before that, Washington DC, in 1989. No further records of his residence anywhere are available.Worse still, at Ben's bank, his account is empty, and there are no records of any activity since it was opened. Ben is relieved when Floyd shows up, but that relief is short-lived when Floyd pulls a gun on him.Floyd makes Ben and Amy get in a car and drive down the autoroute. He refuses to answer Ben's questions on what is going on, why he's doing what he's doing, or who he's working for. Floyd only tells Ben that he told him to go home, and now he has been sent, not only for Ben, but for Amy as well.Ben reminds Amy that he always told her to put her seat belt on. Once she's buckled in, he slams down on the gas, speeding up the car. When Floyd grabs Amy by the throat and menaces her, Ben slams on the brakes. Floyd is pitched forward, his head slamming into the windshield. Ben grabs at Floyd and wrestles for his gun. The car filps over and rolls down an incline onto a lower road on the superhighway.Amy crawls out of the car, hurt but alive. Floyd emerges and shoots at her, but Ben attacks him and wrestles him to the road. He demands answers, wanting to know what was waiting for him at home. But he hears the sound of Floyd's neck breaking; Floyd is dead.Amy sees Belgian police arrive. Ben tells Amy they can't help. The police see Ben and Amy running across the autoroute, but cannot pursue.Ben breaks into a house on a quiet street, where he bandages his hand and cleans blood off Amy's face. He takes out a locker key Floyd had, with AC stamped on it: Antwerp Central. Amy is freaked out, asking if police or the U.S. State Department, who she knows Ben worked for, can help. Ben tries to tell Amy that he doesn't know what's happening, but not only is his life in danger, but so is hers... and if they both want to live, he desperately needs her to stay with him and listen to him.Floyd also had a roll of cash, which Ben uses to take a train to Antwerp Central with Amy. As they sit in a cafe, they watch a news report on the car crash they'd been in. Ben points out security cameras in the station to Amy, telling her that corners are safe, and she needs to keep her head down at all times, which will make it harder for cameras to provide enough of a view of her for a profile match. He tells her to stay in the cafe while he goes to the lockers.Amy notices a few police officers converging and pointing in the general direction Ben went, suggesting they might have made him. Getting scared, she hurries after Ben, while Ben is seen opening the locker that the key is for, breaking something off its top wall. Amy searches for Ben, finding herself face to face with the Antwerp Central Police. But she manages to make it to the stairway, where Ben finds her, using a map and speaking Croatian so they don't appear suspicious to the people around them.On the train again, Ben goes over a folder that was attached to the top bulkhead of Floyd's locker. He finds pictures of Mei Ling, several other colleagues of Ben's... and several photos of Amy, including one taken of her four months ago, with her grandfather in New Haven, back in the U.S. Looking at the map, Ben notes that Mei Ling and the other colleagues all live within a five mile radius. Amy points out the nearest hospital in the area: St. Cornelius.Ben bribes the morgue worker for access. The morgue attendant takes Ben and Amy to the mortuary and shows Mei Ling's body, which was found floating in the Scheldt river, with her blood alcohol five times the limit... and she's listed as living in France, with no family; an undocumented immigrant. The attendant gives Ben ten minutes to do what he wishes.Ben opens the other body bags and finds that the corpses are all of his co-workers, all dead of home-related injuries, all listed as illegal immigrants to Belgium. He then finds a code number written on Mei Ling's hand: the patent number for the biometric scanner she'd been examining. He writes it down and notes that Walter, the Halgate security, isn't among the bodies. Although Ben doesn't answer her, Amy is horrified to understand that she and Ben would be among the dead bodies, if they'd been home the previous night like they were supposed to be.Amy storms away, refusing to let Ben touch her. She's starting to understand that Ben has skills everyday people just don't have, including how to move through a crowd without being seen and how to kill with his bare hands. He tries desperately to calm her down, but stops short when he sees Walter standing by a hospital floor receptionist. Walter fires at Ben but misses. As Ben and Amy flee, Walter turns to the receptionist and coldly eliminates her.Walter stalks Ben and Amy through the hospital, trying to kill them. Ben bars a double door with a walker, but Walter easily busts through it. On another floor, Walter is searching for them. Just as he finds Amy hiding in one of the closets, Ben tackles him and they fight. Walter stuns Ben with several blows and is about to kill him when Amy jumps on Walter's back. He knocks her off and down to the ground, but Ben stabs him several times with medical scissors, then grabs Walter's gun and empties the clip into his chest.Evading Belgian police, Ben and Amy hide in a medical supply room, where Ben treats a graze wound on Amy's arm. Hearing more police in pursuit, they escape through a window and Ben steals a car. In a hotel bathroom, Ben bandages Amy's arm and tells her how he knew about the bodies: Floyd was a professional assassin following a government-training protocol. All the photos and profiles in his locker was a targeted hit list-- which Amy and Ben were on. Ben was not working for the State Department, as Amy's mother told her; he was a CIA agent.Anna Brandt is handed some papers for an upcoming Pan-African council. She attends a meeting where she is briefed on the deaths of Floyd and Walter, and that Ben-- who used to work under Anna's command-- is suspected of killing them both. Anna says that Ben was decommissioned six months ago because he'd 'grown a conscience,' and the oversight decided to make an example of him by expatriating him, making sure he can never return to the United States.Anna's superiors show video footage of the hit on a \"\"Black Vault\"\" in Brussels; the one shown being raided at the start of the movie. The robber knew how to defeat the vault's security systems",and the canister he stole contained top secret documents being collected for the Department of Justice,working with the Belgian Secret Service.

The Family,2013,111,Comedy,6.3,Luc Besson,Luc Besson,Domenick Lombardozzi,Robert De Niro,Robert De Niro,John D'Leo,"\"The camera pans out on a family of four eating a meal together. The doorbell rings, and the husband/father answers. As he puts his eye to the peephole, a bomb explodes, blowing his corpse back to the dining table. The wife/mother frantically tries to call the police as a man in a black hat and coat walks through the destroyed door, holding a gun. He rubs out the rest of the family, including both adolescent kids, without a word. He then takes a hatchet from his briefcase and hacks off a finger from the man's hand.The voice of Fred Blake (Robert De Niro) says that the only question people should ask is the value of a man's life. Fred says he's worth $20 million, and he'd give away the entire fortune to get his old life back.Fred is riding in a car driven by his wife, Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer), while their two kids, Warren (John D'Leo) and Belle (Dianna Agron) ride in the back with the family dog, Malavita. They're all heading toward a new home in Cholong-sur-Avre in Normandy, France. Maggie is unsure of the house's exact location because the houses on the street have no numbers, but Fred is able to locate the correct house due to instructions from an acquaintance named Stansfield.They all get settled in, unpacking some of their belongings, which are already there (although the TV is late in arriving). During small talk, it's revealed that the Blake family has lived in the Riviera and Paris.Maggie offers to help Fred unpack, but he tells her to get the kids to bed, as they have school the very next day. The real reason, however, is that unknown to the rest of the family, Fred had a dead body in the trunk. He buries it in the back yard while nobody is looking.In the morning, over breakfast, it's revealed that the Blake family has used different surnames in different parts of France. After Warren and Belle leave for school, Maggie tells Fred she's going to pick up groceries, and that Stansfield said that until he arrives that day, Fred shouldn't step outside the house. They need to come up with something to tell the neighbors, and if anyone were to ask, they should say they're American.The Blake family are federal witnesses. Fred's real name is Giovanni Manzoni, and he and his family were part of a mafia family from Brooklyn. Giovanni's grandfather drove one of the cars at the funeral procession for Vito Genovese's wife, and Gio's father was one of 107 mob bosses to attend a notorious 1957 Apalachian Convention. Giovanni and his family are in Witness protection because he turned informant and testified against a high-ranking Don named Luchese (Stan Carp), sending him to jail. Squeaking rats being one of the most despised things among the mafia, the whole Manzoni family has a $20 million bounty on their heads. Stansfield is the family's FBI contact.Soon as Maggie is gone, Fred steps outside. He's seen through a camera lens, and he seems to turn right toward it, as if he knows the person or persons with the camera, are there. Later, he rummages through some of the family belongings until he finds something he appears to prize: a manual typewriter.The Manzonis waste little time starting to run afoul of the locals and the way of life in Cholong-sur-Avre, and they deal with it the best way they know how: mafia style. Maggie stops for coffee and learns the closest sightseeing attractions are in another town, twenty kilometers distant. Warren runs into a group of young French students led by Andre (Jonas Bloquet), who want to shake him down for some cash, take his backtalk with disdain, and mudhole stomp him in a locker room.Maggie is annoyed with the stereotypical anti-American sentiment of the French grocery store owner and two French customers. She grabs some materials that act as a makeshift explosive and sets it off in the back of the store, destroying much of it.Meeting for lunch, Belle and Warren strategize. As the outsiders in a foreign school, they need to stick close together. Warren has cased a majority of the students and has learned who runs 'contraband' (like cigarettes), and who can be exploited for what-- including the potential to turn the tables on Andre's gang, who beat him up and hit on Belle.Fred begins typing a memoir of his life on the typewriter. Later, he goes out into the backyard and is spotted by a neighbor tending to his rose garden. The neighbor strikes up small talk, which proves troublesome for Fred. Asked about his work, he says he's a writer. Afraid to say he writes novels, because he doesn't know anything about it, he says he's writing about the armed forces landing at Normandy on D-Day... and finds his neighbor knows a lot about this subject; much more than Fred himself.Maggie visits a church, where the local priest makes her acquaintance. He greets new arrivals cordially, which is something Maggie feels she and her family need right now.After school is done for the day, Warren goes right to work. He finds that an engineer's son collects trading cards for the Paris S.G. and is only missing one card, ready to give anything in return for it. Warren assures the youth he'll see if he can help acquire it. Meanwhile, Belle is walking home when Andre and his gang start following her in their car, offering her a ride. When Belle realizes she missed a turn trying to ignore them, they take advantage, asking where she lives and then telling her it's miles away, and it'll be dark before she gets home. Against her better judgment, Belle accepts the offer of a ride, and she doesn't need long to see through the French boys' charm; they drive to a local leisure park and lay down a picnic blanket. They clearly have seduction on their minds. Their overconfidence proves deadly, as they allow Belle to rummage through the trunk of their car, where she finds a tennis racket. She knocks Andre down and viciously bashes the racket against his head until it breaks, before giving the shocked boys a stern lecture on how young women deserve to be treated. She gets in their car and drives off, leaving them there. She drives partway home before leaving the car on the shoulder of the road and walking the rest of the way.The scene shifts to Attica State prison, where a guard delivers a bucket of ice to Don Luchese. Despite being in prison for life, Luchese lives like a king, with a private cell furnished nearly as well as a good quality motel room, and at least one of the guards caters to him as well. One of Luchese's underlings is in the prison with him. He takes the bucket and dumps it in the sink; among the ice is the finger hacked off from the man who was killed the beginning of the movie. The ice kept it fresh so that Luchese is able to take a fingerprint and compare it to Fred's prints from a copy of his Buffalo police record. The prints don't match, so Luchese knows that the Manzonis are still alive. They call Rocco (Jon Freda), who carried out the hit, to inform him, and he promises to continue looking.The Manzonis are making small talk over dinner when Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones) shows up to see how their first day went. He's also there to make sure the Manzonis behave themselves: two weeks ago, in Nice, Maggie bought a dozen lobsters from a man named Mourad, that turned out to be rotten; Fred beat Mourad to a pulp, and two days ago, Mourad went missing (he's the stiff that Fred buried in the backyard). That the Manzonis bought a whole dozen lobsters smacks of a 'business deal;' the kind the Manzonis aren't allowed to make, as per the terms of the Witness Protection program. Stansfield has had to relocate the Manzonis numerous times because of how they all handle 'fitting in' at each new place. His job is to keep them safe, but they're making his job very hard.That night, Fred has a nightmare about a party he and Luchese's men co-hosted back in Brooklyn; he happens to turn and look at Luchese, who runs a finger across his throat, and suddenly every guest at the party turns toward Giovanni, pointing a gun at him.Fred is at his typewriter again, continuing his memoirs. He says, in a voiceover, that Stansfield's duty is to tell the 'official' version of what happened to get a $20 million bounty on the lives of all four Manzonis. Fred wants to write down the whole truth, just once, without any deception, even if nobody reads it. He says his story is impossible to just make up. It turns out Maggie has suspected what Fred was up to, and she's plenty angry about it, even a single typed hardcopy, as opposed to something written on computer disk, is at risk of being seen by the wrong eyes. Maggie insists she could have been consulted, but the last time Fred did that, she had him say he was an architect and suddenly everyone was coming to him for advice on expanding their homes. For now, Maggie wants her husband to be a plumber; the sink's tap water is brown, and can't be trusted for washing or drinking. She called the local plumber twice and he never showed.Maggie steps outside, looking around for prying eyes, and goes to a nearby house where two FBI agents, Caputo (Domenick Lombardozzi) and DiCicco (Jimmy Palumbo), are watching over their safety. She brings them some home-cooked food, making pleasant small talk. Unlike Fred, Maggie knows the value of proper diplomacy and keeping on the agents' good side... and she can use the company, being Americans in a country infamous for not looking kindly on most Americans. During small talk, it's revealed that Stansfield is arranging for the Manzonis to host a block barbeque to meet and get acquainted with most of the neighbors.The next day at school, during lunch, Belle and Warren again strategize. Warren has been hard at work doing 'business' of his own; he's made a fake copy of the last trading card the engineer's son needs; in return he gets a copy of math homework which he trades to another student for another favor. He also gets a copy of the Goth girl's school report, promising to alter it in a way her parents would like, in return for an equal share of the cigarette market. He also 'picked up' a splinter so he could raid the school nurse's medicine cabinet for some energy pills he sells. Belle, meanwhile, found out who took something from her purse, and beat the girl to a pulp in the rest room.Belle looks across the lunch room and her gaze falls across a handsome young man, who Warren knows is a college student doing substitute teaching work for a disliked regular who's on maternity leave. The substitute is studying for a very difficult math exam, and all the senior-level girls have the hots for him.Still with Caputo and DiCicco, Maggie looks through their binoculars with which they spy on, and gather information about, all the neighbors, to watch for any security threats. Maggie also sees the plumber show up at her house, and smiles to herself in satisfaction.The plumber, Ramirez (Tonio Descanvelle), tells Fred that the brown water could be a result of either the house's pipes, which are very old, or the town water mains. If it's the mains, the Manzonis would need to take it up with the town mayor; if it's the pipes, they'll need a full overhaul, which will cost a great deal of money and take a great deal of time. Ramirez gets very condescending and rude as he suggests Fred call Ramirez's wife, pay 50% up front and make another appointment. He boasts about his family, fathers and sons, being plumbers for five generations.When Ramirez asks Fred about his line of work, Fred turns toward a nook in the basement and pulls out a baseball bat. Cut to Maggie still watching through the binoculars, and she sees Fred carrying an unconscious Ramirez out of the house and putting him in the back of his plumber van, before Fred gets into the driver's seat and drives the van off.As school ends, Belle makes her move on the substitute, Henri (Oisín Stack), telling him she needs private tutoring in math.Andre and gang meets the engineer's son to acquire a hi-fi they need for a pre-prom party, only to find that the engineer's son and several other students are working with Warren. The bully gang gets their taste of being on the wrong end of a beatdown.Fred has brought Ramirez to a hospital after having beaten him with an inch of his life with the baseball bat. He's unable to explain to the doctor how Ramirez became so badly injured from 'a fall down stairs,' but finally provides a street-smart escape by saying he's not a doctor himself.Rocco is speaking with Mourad's family, showing them a photo of Fred. He's posing as an FBI agent looking into disappearances. Mourad's wife tells Rocco that Fred is a friend of her husband, and unlike in the photo, he has a beard now. Rocco's questioning makes one of the sons suspicious and he asks to see Rocco's FBI badge. Rocco flashes an evil smile as he agrees to the request, and we then see him looking around shiftily as he steps out of the apartment, after he's killed the whole family.Fred is writing his memoirs, and in a voiceover and flashbacks, he goes over a list of ten points that show he's a 'good guy;' of course, the flashbacks show scenes of his time running a crime ring in Brooklyn that demonstrate just how 'good' of a guy he really is. His top point is that he only causes pain with good reason. Cut to his beating Ramirez senseless with the baseball bat, pounding on him until the bat breaks, and then picking up where he left off with a short-handled mallet.Maggie confronts Fred about crippling Ramirez, but he shuts her up by pointing out he knows about the supermarket she blew up. He starts coming on to his wife, and she's reluctant at first, but Fred knows how to turn the charm up in ways she can't resist.Preparing for the barbecue, Maggie tells Belle that Henri called to find out what time it was. Despite Belle's protests that he's just tutoring her in math, Maggie knows what is really on her daughter's long-term goal list. Warren arrives home with bottles of Coca-Cola, assuring his mother that the French neighbors will be expecting 'greasy, fatty American slop' from the American family living among their midst.As Warren predicted, the whole neighborhood shows up for the barbeque. Stansfield calls Caputo and DiCicco and tells them to go too, as all the neighbors are there and they need to blend in.Maggie greets the incoming guests, playing perfect hostess, until she notices one neighbor (who Caputo and DiCocco had told her, was kleptomaniac) quietly pocketing some silverware. Maggie pours the neighbnr some champagne and whispers to her to put the silverware back or Maggie will break her arms.Fred hasn't come out yet; he's still writing. Maggie sends Belle to get him. Fred quietly tells Belle one of his regrets; despite the zeal with which he carried out his work as a crime boss, he regrets not always having done right by his kids. Belle assures him that she loves him and wouldn't trade him for any other father, and this convinces him to come out.No sooner is Fred preparing the barbeque, however, when several neighbors start telling him that the method he's using isn't efficient, and how he should really be doing it for better results. He smiles politely, but his eyes show his irritation. As they continue laughing, we see Fred lose his cool and start maiming them-- until Stansfield taps his shoulder, showing it was just Fred imagining it. Sharing a drink with Fred at the bar, Stansfield reveals that Whalberg, a contact who's recently been elected to the Senate, was worried about Fred telling the latest neighbors that he's a writer. Whalberg and Stansfield know that Fred is writing personal memoirs, and Stansfield is there to caution him about what he puts in them, and whether or not it's a good idea to let anyone see them.As the party is wrapping up, Maggie comforts Belle about Henri not having shown, and Stansfield drops a not-so-subtle warning to Fred regarding one of Gio's former associates.The next morning as they walk to school, Warren tells Belle that Fred can turn the word 'fuck' into one of the most versatile in the human vocabulary, which makes it curious how he spends so much time writing.Fred goes to see the mayor about the town water main, only to be given a runaround. The mayor insists that the water main is working normally and makes a sticking point about the Manzonis being new in town. Fred shakes hands politely, but we see him enjoying the thought of grabbing the mayor and using the mayor's desk drawer to crush his fingers.At the school study hall, Henri notes that Belle has improved considerably, but she sees she really has her work cut out for her when she learns that once he passes his exams, he plans to move to Paris in search of a full-time main teaching position.Meanwhile, following the trail, Fred visits the town water main. The maintenance supervisor shows that the water is already brown when it reaches the water main, and he suspects a nearby chemical fertilizing plant; the only one of its kind in the area.Maggie is praying at church when the priest arrives. The priest notes that Maggie often comes to pray during midday, but never at Mass. He asks if she's interested in making confession. Maggie warily asks about priest confidentiality, and he assures her that the oath is sacred.During class, one of Warren's teachers requests a homework assignment that's overdue from him; a short story written in English, on wordplay and double meanings, for the school newspaper. She gives him a strict deadline, leaving him scrambling to come up with something on the fly. Remembering a neighborhood mafia party at which all of Luchese's family were present, Warren remembers a double entendre recited by Luchese regarding Boris Godunov: \"\"If it's Godunov for you","it's good enough for me.\"\" The much younger Warren had found it funny and laughed along with it. Warren quickly writes it all down for his teacher",and it's printed in the school newspaper. Of course,"a copy of this newspaper ends up in the one pair of hands it was never meant for: Don Luchese (a funny series of actions shows how the paper arrives in his cell and gets his attention). He recognizes the short story immediately and glares at the credit: \"\"Warren Blake"
Clouds of Sils Maria,2014,124,Drama,6.7,Olivier Assayas,Olivier Assayas,Aljoscha Stadelmann,Hanns Zischler,Brady Corbet,Johnny Flynn,"The opening scene shows a young woman named Valentine (Kristen Stewart) on the phone. She is the personal assistant to Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche), a successful French-born international actress. On the phone, Valentine gets a call from someone claiming that Maria is holding up the proceedings of her divorce. Valentine claims that's nonsense, since Maria is the one who started the divorce in the first place. Valentine is seen having to juggle taking calls from two different cell phones.Maria was a character called Nemesis in an X-Men film, but doesn't want to be in any sequels. She tells Valentine that she is sick of acting on wires in front of a green screen, so Valentine is able to get her out of the film and her name off of the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) page for the sequel, as people are constantly blogging about her in the film. Valentine tells her that her fans will be disappointed, but Maria doesn't care.Maria and Valentine are heading to an event where Maria is to accept an award on someone else's behalf. That person is Wilhelm Melchior, a playwright and director, who casted Maria for a role in a play that propelled her to stardom. The play centers on the tempestuous relationship between a young girl and an older woman who is eventually driven to suicide.Later, Valentine gets a call telling her that Wilhelm has passed away. This has now put the ceremony in a different light. The plan was for Maria and Valentine to go to the award ceremony, afterwards they were supposed to head out to Wilhelm's place in Sils Maria, which Maria still insists on going to.In light of Wilhelm's passing, Maria finds out that the people behind the ceremony have invited actor Henryk Wald (Hanns Zischler). Maria really objects to this as she does not get along with Henryk. Maria considers not attending. She changes her mind once its announced that Henryk will accept the award if Maria does not attend. Those putting on the ceremony feel that Wilhelm wrote his work with Henryk in mind for different roles.When they get to Maria's hotel room, Valentine finds out what Henryk is really like. Maria tells her that all Henryk wants is the spotlight. He is perverse, violent and hits women. Henryk wanted Maria, but disliked her when she wouldn't give in to his advances.At the ceremony, Maria gets a call from Rosa, Wilhelm's widow, who tells her that she is glad that Maria is there to accept the award. Rosa also tells Maria what Wilhelm really thought of Henryk, saying the less you understand about him, the better and when you understand nothing about him, hes excellent. Rosa, breaking down in tears, tells Maria that she has to tell her something. It is inferred from Maria's responses that Wilhelm was diagnosed with something life-threatening, but instead of battling it, he instead swallowing something that led to his death.At the event, Maria has a conversation with Henryk when he comes into the lounge area. Henryk tells her that he saw Wilhelm two weeks ago when they went fishing together. Maria tells him that she spent time with Wilhelm and Rosa six months ago. When Henryk says he knew about that, Maria tells him that she doesn't care that he knew.After Henryk leaves, Maria reveals to Valentine that she had an affair with Henryk when they were shooting a movie together. Valentine says she figured so. Maria says that she was only 18 and that he took advantage of her. Henryk soon abandoned her and she didn't see him for 10 years. Afterwards, she hit it big and Henryk became interested in her again. This time, she didn't give in to his advances, which is why there's tension between the two.At the hotel, Valentine arranges a meeting for Maria with Klaus Diesterweg (Lars Eidinger). He is a director planning a remake of Maloja Snake, except this time, he wants Maria to take the role of the older woman who is seduced by the younger woman. Maria tells Klaus that after all these years she still feels like that part is still who she is and doesn't feel right letting someone else take that role. Klaus tells her that Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloe Grace Moretz) will be playing the role of the younger woman. Klaus tells Maria that Jo-Ann has had a smaller career, having done a superhero film that just opened in the U.S., but that she's a lot more interesting than her profile suggests.Klaus tells Maria that Jo-Ann admires her and is willing to opt out of her other commitments in order to do the play with Maria. Maria tells Klaus that, at the current moment, shes in the middle of a divorce and shes feeling alone and vulnerable. So, she doesn't feel like doing this movie. Klaus tells her that he will understand if Maria chooses not to do the movie, but tells her that it will be a missed opportunity, not just for her, but for Wilhelm.Before he leaves, Maria tells Klaus that the actress, who played the older woman in the play, died a year later in a car accident and that she has always associated that with the suicide of her character in the play. Klaus says he remembers her, but remarks that she was a lousy actress who didn't understand a thing about the role. Klaus tells Maria that she should be grateful to her, since her lousy acting highlighted Maria's performance.Maria talks with Henryk as they head back to the hotel. As she is about to go to her room, a drunk Maria gives Henryk her room number. Later on, she stands by her hotel phone, but gives up on him. She takes her tablet out and does a Google search on Jo-Ann.A title card comes on the screen saying: PART TWOMaria and Valentine are headed to Sils Maria. Maria tells Valentine that she shouldn't have said yes to Klaus. Valentine says that Klaus is a good director and the pay is good. Maria says she doesn't need the money.Maria arrives at Wilhelm's house and is greeted by Rosa. Rosa tells her to stay as long as she wants. Rosa and Maria go hiking up the hills of Sils Maria. On another day, Rosa, Maria and Valentine watch one of Wilhelm's old films that he directed. Rosa soon leaves because of all the memories associated there. This leaves Maria and Valentine alone with the house.Later at dinner, Maria and Valentine discuss Wilhelm, when Maria reveals that she was attracted to him, but didn't act on it because it would have ruined their working relationship. Valentine asks her if she was in love in him, Maria says of course she was.After dinner, Valentine tells Maria about Jo-Ann's history. She tells her that there are numerous nude photos of her online and that her boyfriend broke up with her because she couldn't stop getting drunk and cheating on him with his friends in public. Valentine elaborates even more by saying that Jo-Ann went to her boyfriend's house with a gun and he threw her out of his house violently. Maria says that she doesn't sound anything like the way Klaus described her. Valentine continues on saying that Jo-Ann shot up her boyfriends place and was only stopped when the neighbors got involved and subdued her until the police arrived. Jo-Ann chose instead to go to rehab in order to get out of going to jail.Valentine tells Maria that she respects Jo-Ann because shes not afraid to be herself. Maria says there's nothing cool in getting wasted and almost killing their boyfriend. Valentine says that Jo-Ann is probably her favorite actress, to which Maria says you mean more than me? Valentine says that she didn't mean it like that.Upstairs in her room, Maria sees a YouTube video of Jo-Ann confronting a paparazzi cameraman who is following her. In the video, Jo-Ann gets out of the car she is in and throws her purse at the paparazzi's car and threatens to kill him unless he stops following her. She also watches Jo-Ann's DUI arrest video. A third video shows a press junket where Jo-Ann is asked questions about the upcoming play. A reporter asks Jo-Ann who is directing it. She responds Klaus. When they ask her if he has a last name, she responds Klaus. You know, THE Klaus. The reporters there begin laughing at Jo-Ann's response. Visibly embarrassed as to not knowing Klaus last name, Jo-Ann goes on a verbal rant telling the reporter that he needs to do his job and look him up.The next day, Valentine helps Maria with her lines.Later on Valentine and Maria go hiking to a lake, where they end up going skinny-dipping. Valentine says she will have to leave Maria for a few hours so she can go see her boyfriend, Burt. Maria says she'll be okay by herself for a few hours. She is also glad that Valentine has a boyfriend.After Valentine leaves, Maria has a conversation with her agent and tells him that she wishes to be let out of her contract. She tells him that she has practiced her lines, but doesn't wish to do the part. Since she signed a contract, he tells her that if she doesn't, the producers will sue and it will go on for months and months. She asks for him to get her out of it, but he says that it is going to cost a lot. On her way back, Valentine drives through twisty mountain roads in the fog. At one point, she pulls over and throws up.Sometime later, Maria and Valentine go to see Jo-Ann's newest 3D film. Afterwards, they go gambling. After they finish, they eat at the casino. During the meal, they talk about the film. Maria said that she could feel herself losing brain cells watching the movie. Valentine asks Maria if she found Jo-Ann amazing, because she did. Maria said that she played a dumb character. They both agree that she has a screen presence.After having a few drinks during dinner, Valentine gets in the drivers seat and pulls out into a parked car. Maria tells her to hurry up and go. Valentine speeds out of the parking lot.The next day, they both go hiking where they rehearse more of the play. Maria begins to see the play as phony. Valentine believes that plays can sometimes be more real than life itself. After lunch, Maria and Valentine both fall asleep on the mountain. Valentine wakes up and notices that it is almost dark. She wakes Maria up and tells her that its getting dark. Maria tells her that she knows a shortcut that will get them back faster.As it gets dark, Valentine tells Maria that if she doesn't agree with the way she sees things, she doesn't have to keep her around. Maria says that she knows that. She likes having Valentine as her assistant. They eventually make their way to town and they take a bus back to the house.The next day, they practice lines again. Maria still cannot see herself as the older woman character. Valentine tells her that she might be able to if she accepts the part like she did the younger character years ago. Valentine believes that it might be because she is reading the part to Maria. Valentine believes that she is uncomfortable reading the part and that it isn't helping Maria.A few days later, Maria and Valentine go to a hotel to see Jo-Ann. Jo-Ann has come down to officially meet Maria. Jo-Ann is there with her boyfriend, Christopher Giles (Johnny Flynn). Jo-Ann tells Maria that after seeing a movie that she did with Harrison Ford, it inspired her to want to become an actress. Jo-Ann tells Maria that she knows that she wont be as good at the role as Maria was, but she hopes that she doesn't judge her too harshly. She also tells Maria that its incredibly brave of her to tackle the role of the older woman. Maria tells her that its just a job and that she'll be moving on when its over.After the meeting, Valentine heads to the front desk when the attendant asks her if she is still interested in seeing the snake (this is apparently some kind of attraction up in the mountains of Sils Maria). Valentine says that she does. The man at the front desk gives her instructions on how to get there.Maria tells Valentine that Jo-Ann was not like the girl that she was expecting. She says that she was really nice. Valentine tells Maria that Jo-Ann spent the whole evening flattering her and that's why she likes her. Maria says that has nothing to do with it. Valentine says of course not. Valentine tells Maria that Christopher is a well-known writer, who also happens to be married.The next morning, Maria and Valentine are on their way to see the snake, but on the way there, they have an argument about the right path to get there. They get to the top of the mountain where Maria believes that she sees the snake. When she asks Valentine if that is it, she turns around and does not see her anywhere. Maria goes around and calls after her, to no avail. Valentine is gone without a trace.After a short musical interlude, a title card flashes on the screen:EPILOGUE, LONDON, A FEW WEEKS LATERMaria is about to meet Klaus for dinner. On the way to dinner, Klaus tells Maria that Christopher's wife has attempted suicide after learning about her husbands affair. At dinner, Jo-Ann arrives and tells Klaus that Christopher is on his way. Klaus says that is a bad idea, because the paparazzi will be following him and will paint Jo-Ann and Christopher in a bad light. Christopher arrives at the restaurant.Klaus gives Christopher his home address and tells him to meet them there. On the way out, Maria and Jo-Ann get into a limo. The paparazzi follow behind them.At Klaus place, he says that the media is going to crucify Christopher. Jo-Ann says that she will take the blame, even if it means them painting her as a home wrecker. Klaus takes Maria home in a taxi.The next day, Maria is looking over her lines for the play. Her new assistant arrives and asks her if she would be interested in doing a sci-fi film about a mutant. Maria says shell look at the script in a few days and get back to the director. Her new assistant asks Maria if she would like for her to help practice her lines, but Maria declines. It is clear that Maria misses Valentine.On another day, the cast is doing one of the final dress rehearsals for the play. Afterwards, Maria asks Jo-Ann if she could do one scene a particular way. It is a scene where the younger woman leaves the older woman after everything is said and done. The way that Jo-Ann did the scene was that she just walked away from Maria's character. Maria tells Jo-Ann that when she played the character years ago, she made one final glance to the older woman character. Maria tells her that the audience thought it was more powerful. At that point, Jo-Ann says, at that point in the play, nobody cares about the older woman character. Jo-Ann says the character is washed-up. She tells Maria that she is talking about the character and not specifically about her. Through Maria's facial expressions, she does take it as Jo-Ann insulting her. Maria tells her that she still thinks it works, but Jo-Ann doesn't believe that it does. Maria chooses not to pursue it any further.On opening night, Maria meets with the director of the mutant film. Maria says that she doesn't believe that the part works for her, even though he tells her that he wrote the part with Maria in mind. She believes that he wrote the part with a younger Maria in mind. Maria recommends Jo-Ann, but he doesn't want Jo-Ann in the part. He tells Maria that he dislikes this current era with stars like Jo-Ann and viral videos. He wants Maria for the part because she comes from a different era than Jo-Ann.The final scene shows Maria on stage, in character, smoking. It is implied that she has become more like the older woman in the play.","boring, cruelty",test,imdb
