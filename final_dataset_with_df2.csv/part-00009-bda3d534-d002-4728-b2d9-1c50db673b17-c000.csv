Cyrano de Bergerac,1950,113,Drama,7.4,Michael Gordon,Edmond Rostand,William Prince,José Ferrer,Albert Cavens,Ralph Clanton,"\"In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose. Le Bret suggests they go out to eat, but Cyrano says he has no money left, as all he had was in the bag he threw at the theater manager -- a costly grand gesture that he does not regret.A beautiful fruit seller (Elena Verdugo) overhears Cyrano, offers him food and wine from a buffet prepared for the theater patrons, and mentions her admiration for his poetry and bravery. But he refuses charity food, accepting only a grape, a sip of water and half a macaroon. This is his way of acknowledging her regard while emphasizing his disdain for money.Le Bret points out to Cyrano that the girl's admiration indicates he has real possibilities of being loved despite his nose. He also tells him that Roxane watched his duel with an excited fascination that surely was encouraging.Roxane's servant reenters to arrange a meeting between Roxane and Cyrano the next morning after church. Cyrano, becoming bold, says he will wait at the pastry shop run by his friend Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan).At this point, pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau approaches Cyrano for help. Ragueneau has been warned that De Guiche, whom Ragueneau has mocked in published poetry, has hired a hundred ruffians to give him a beating that night, and he asks to sleep at Cyrano's. Cyrano scoffs at the threat, promising Ragueneau he will escort him safely home. The mob of ruffians appears as Cyrano walks with Ragueneau on a dark and deserted street and Cyrano alone routs them, wounding many and killing eight.The next day at the pastry shop, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince). She has never even spoken to Christian, but wants Cyrano to protect him. Cyrano hides his devastation and promises to help.At a gathering of the regiment, rookie recruit Christian de Neuvillette is being made fun of by the others. Christian asks the captain how he can establish himself, and the captain answers he must not accept mocking and must somehow demonstrate his valor. Christian is also advised never to mention the word nose or anything related to noses when Cyrano is present, or face the consequences. Moments later, Cyrano arrives to tell about his routing of the hundred ruffians hired to beat up Ragueneau. Christian, from the sidelines, interrupts the telling by adding the word nose whenever he can work it into the story, as in \"\"It was so dark you couldn't see . . . BEYOND YOUR NOSE.\"\"At the first such interruption",Cyrano stops and menacingly asks who that new face might be,and he is told the young man's name is Christian de Neuvillette.

The War of the Worlds,1953,85,Action,7.0,Byron Haskin,H.G. Wells,William Phipps,Robert Cornthwaite,Vernon Rich,Lewis Martin,"The film begins with a voice (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) telling the audience that greedy eyes are watching the blue planet. They envy our water, clean air and plenty of resources. The race of beings watching the blue planet had considered moving to another planet in the Solar System but were unable because every other planet is uninhabitable. Also, it tells us that there has been a WWI and a WWII, but that there is going to be another kind of war, The War of the Worlds. At a time when the Earth and Mars were closest to each other in orbit, the Mars beings begin to attack.A strange fireball streaks across the southern California skies and lands in a gully in the San Gabriel mountains east of Los Angeles. Firemen quickly extinguish the fire that has broken out, but authorities are puzzled by the long, cylindrical object that fell to earth and started the fire. The object attracts tourists--and also the attention of Dr. Clayton Forester (Gene Barry) of the Pacific Technical Institute. While everyone else regards the object as anything from a tourist attraction to a potential treasure trove, Forester knows that something is wrong: the object did not come down like an ordinary meteor, and was much more lightweight than any meteor ever reported. What's more, the object is not only hot, but also radioactive.Forester stays in the nearby town at the home of Pastor Matthew Collins (Lewis Martin) and his niece, Sylvia van Buren (Ann Robinson). Three men are left in the surroundings of the object when a hidden lid on the cylinder unscrews, and a long-necked probe rises out. The three try to approach the probe, declaring their friendly intentions--and the probe spits out a heat ray that incinerates the men and starts another fire. At the same time, power and telephone service fails in town, and everyone at the social discovers that his watch has stopped. Forester determines that the watches have been somehow magnetized, and also notes that someone's pocket compass points not to the north, but to the meteorite. Forester returns to the site with the sheriff and another deputy. They find the ashes of the three men, and then the probe attacks again, killing the deputy as he tries to drive away. Forester then determines that they are dealing with something from another planet and need to call in the military, especially as another fireball lands nearby as he is talking to the sheriff. While everyone waits for the soldiers to arrive, Forester appears on a radio program and deals with the increasing speculation on the otherworldly origin of the cylinders. A consensus arises that the cylinders come from Mars, now at its closest approach to Earth.Marines from El Toro Marine Base roll in and surround the site, and an Air Force plane drops a flare on it from above. The long-necked probe fires its heat ray at the plane, and then sweeps the area, destroying a radio truck. The Marine colonel calls for reinforcements, and the 6th Army Command arrives, with artillery and tanks. Major General Mann, the commander, tells Forester that other objects like the one they are surrounding have landed in cities all over the world, and that all communication fails after that. Then the probe rises again, and we now see that it is part of a swan-like magnetically levitating low-altitude craft. Two other such craft rise out of the cylinder to join it. The officers give the order to prepare to fire, but Matthew Collins objects, saying that no one has tried to offer them peace before. Disregarding his own safety, he walks toward the three metal swans, reciting the 23rd psalm--and before his niece Sylvia's horrified eyes, the lead swan burns him to death. At once General Mann (Les Tremayne) and Marine Colonel Heffner (Vernon Rich) give the order to fire.The soldiers unleash a barrage of artillery and missile fire--and none of it is effective. The swans possess a magnetic force shield that deflects any bombardment. The swans quietly take the measure of their opponents and then start to return fire, with heat rays and meson-disrupting energy bursts that disintegrate anything they touch. Forester urges Mann to inform Washington that conventional military forces would be outmatched. Mann leaves, and Heffner fights a holding action before finally ordering a complete retreat--and being disintegrated in mid-order.Forester takes Sylvia with him in an Army plane. Flying low to avoid the Air Force jets flying in to try their hand, he clips some trees and crash-lands. He and Sylvia barely have time to escape before a squadron of swans surround the plane. General Mann returns to the city, where skeptical reporters cannot believe his reassurances--and of course he knows better, because nothing has proved effective.Alone in the brush, Forester and Sylvia take shelter in an abandoned farmhouse. There Sylvia confesses her fears and her deep sense of loss following her uncle's death. In the middle of this tender conversation, another cylinder crashes into the side of the house. Hours later, Forester wakes up, and a terrified Sylvia tells him that the house is surrounded. Forester works diligently to clear a way out, while also trying to observe as much as he can. The Martians lower a different kind of probe, an eye-like camera; Forester, at first taking this for yet another weapon, chops the camera head from its extender, which swiftly withdraws. A Martian crewman enters the house and touches Sylvia on the shoulder; Forester blinds it with a flashlight and then throws an axe at it, putting it to flight. When Forester realizes that he is holding a scarf now stained with Martian blood, Sylvia loses all control, and Forester has to shout at her to calm down. They then escape, just before the Martians burn down the ruins of the house.As more cylinders come down all over the earth, the Martians' goal becomes painfully clear: to drive all of humanity before them and eventually to kill us all. In Washington, the Secretary of Defense prepares to order the dropping of an atomic bomb on the Los Angeles-area nest. Forester and Sylvia finally arrive at Pacific Tech and turn over the alien camera and the blood-stained scarf. The blood turns out to be anemic, and the camera yields little insight other than that the Martians perceive color a lot differently from humans and that their ability to see is hampered by bright light. At the time, Pacific Tech officials think all this is a moot point, because the atom bomb is going to stop them anyway. But even the atom bomb proves ineffective against the Martians' magnetic force fields.General Mann, clearly frustrated, orders an evacuation of Los Angeles. Forester tells his colleagues that now the anemic blood is important, because only biological weapons will stop the Martians now. The plan is to take as many lab instruments as possible into the mountains and set up another laboratory. But that plan comes to nothing, as looters seize the Pacific Tech vehicles and scatter or beat up all the personnel, including Forester, the pathologist who found out about the anemia, Dr. Dupre (Ann Codee), and Sylvia. As the swans arrive and start systematically burning every building in sight, Forester rushes about, going from church to church, hoping to find Sylvia waiting there, as she once waited after running away as a child. He finds church pastors everywhere praying for deliverance, comfort, or both, and at one church he even finds two of his colleagues. At last he finds Sylvia--and as the two rush toward one another, a nearby swan burns out a stained-glass window, frightening everyone inside.But the attacking swan abruptly heels over, fires only two more seemingly half-hearted bursts, and then crashes into a building and falls to the street. Dead silence descends. Inside the church, Forester leads the people out into the street to see what has happened. They find the downed swan, and as they watch, a door opens and a Martian arm appears, trying to move out. Another swan crashes on the other side of the street and, as Forester watches, the Martian arm turns a mottled gray and falls still. Forester touches it and pronounces it dead.And in fact, this story is repeating itself everywhere. The Martians had very underdeveloped immune systems, and as soon as they were exposed to Earth's atmosphere, they became infected with germs that a humans have long since developed immunity to, but which proved uniformly fatal to Martians. The metal swans stop and fall where they are, and the invasion is over even more swiftly than it began.","good versus evil, realism, cult, murder",train,imdb

The English king sends Sir Rutford (Andrea Checchi), the commander of the British sea forces, to work out a deal with the Vikings. However, Rutford is not interested in making bargains, and stages a surprise attack on the Vikings, thus opening the movie. In the ensuing battle, many Vikings are killed, most of them women and children. King Harald and a few Vikings fight bravely, killing a number of English knights, but he himself is felled by an arrow fired by Rutfords chief assassin. During the battle, Harold's two young sons, Erik and Eron, are whisked away by one of his chiefs. But in the attempt to escape from the beach where the battle rages, Eron is rescued by a few Vikings along with some women and children, but Erik is left behind in the chaos.Later, King Loter arrives on the scene where he threatens to strip Rutford of his title and of his command of the sea forces for the indiscriminate killing of Viking women and children. But Rutford retaliates by having his assassin kill Loter with an arrow, and making it seem that a wounded Viking killed him. Loter's wife, Queen Alice (Francoise Christophe), is greatly distress by the sudden death of her husband, and wonders away. She finds the young Viking boy, Erik, on the beach hiding away from where the carnage happened. Figuring out that he's a Viking, the queen decides to raise Erik as her own son, and takes him back to her castle residence, not realizing that a small tattoo on the boy's chest is a family crest which adorns the chest of both boys. Eron, in the meantime, is returned to the land of the Vikings and vows to spend the rest of his life plotting revenge against the British for the death of his father, and brother.20 years later, the Vikings once again wage war against the British. The adult Eron (Cameron Mitchell), has fallen in love with a vestal virgin named Daya (Ellen Kessler), the identical twin sister of the vestal virgin Rama (Alice Kessler). But because of the pagan Viking custom, she is promised to the gods, and they cannot reveal their love out of fear of being executed. Eron knows that only a king is permitted to marry a vestal virgin, and so he plans to take advantage of the forthcoming war with England to prove his valor and leadership abilities.King Olaf, the leader of the Vikings, makes a pack with Iceland, Norway, and Sweden to form an alliance to invade Britain once again for control of the North Sea. Because of his old age and physical infirmity, Olaf determins that a younger man will have to lead the attack in his place. Olaf chooses Eron, but his choice is resisted by Garan, who fears that Eron will lose sight of the objective by seeking out personal glory. Garan wishes to be elected leader, and a vote by the 20 field chieftains is taken. When the vote is a draw, Olaf determines that they will have to fight to the death. In the ensuring swordfight, Eron is victorious, but refuses to kill his opponent, and asks Garan to lead with him side-by-side. Eron is clearly a man of passion and valor, and although hot-tempered, he has compassion. But his major flaw is that Eron is too trusting.In England, the adult Erik (Giorgio Ardisson) is appointed as Duke of Helford, and leader of the British sea forces, replacing Sir Rutford. Erik's first duty by his mother, Queen Alice, is to stave off the impending Viking invasion. But Rutford is jealous of the young man, and plots to sabotage the mission by planting a spy on board who will set fire to Eriks ship while at sea.The two Viking and English fleets meet in the North Sea, and a sea battle begins. The Vikings board Erik's flagship, just as the spy begins to set fire to it. In the battle, Erik and Eron meet and engage in a swordfight, neither of them aware of their blood kin relationship. However, as Rutford planned, Erik's ship catches afire, enabling the Vikings to advance upon England. Erik jumps overboard, and later washes ashore in Viking land. He is found by Rama, and is immediately smitten with him, but she does not understand the significances of the cross he wears around his neck, and especially when he asks her if she's an angel. Fearing discovery and execution for interaction with a male, Rama points Erik in the direction of a local Viking fishing village and agrees to secretly meet with him later. Because of his blond, Nordic features, Erik is accepted by the Vikings as a ship-wrecked fisherman. One of Erik's crewmembers, also shipwrecked, recognizes him and plots to help him escape when the time is right.Back in England, Sir Rutford proposes marriage to the queen. He accepts the fact that she cares nothing for him, but claims to see the marriage as an opportunity of uniting the country. However, it is apparent that he is only interested in becoming king for his own self-interest. Queen Alice immediately sees though his deception and refuses by saying. \"\"your ambition shows. It devours you.\"\"When the Vikings arrive",Rutford grants them admission into the castle. Eron and his men take over with little difficulty,and Rutford is appointed Regent,with the objective of ruling in Eron's absence. Eron then takes Queen Alice as a hostage back to Viking land

Miguel was shot and killed in her bedroom and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he has developed an immediate attraction to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation.Dejected, Clouseau returns home.

When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Kato (Burt Kwouk), to whom Clouseau has given instructions to attack him when he least expects it to keep his senses sharp. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself.A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows.

Only Maria is innocent of any crime. As a massive row breaks out between employers and staff, the lights are cut (an arrangement Clouseau had made with his assistant), and the guilty take the opportunity to pile into Clouseau's car and escape.

Having witnessed the explosion, and realizing that he has failed again to kill Clouseau, Dreyfus is reduced to an animalistic fury and is taken away.

Carol, their very young daughter, is in bed right in the next room, but she is awake. Heartbroken, Lucy suffers a moment of fury and confusion that leads her to spontaneously pick up a nearby axe and decapitate her husband and his lover while they sleep. Carol watches in terror and shock as Lucy hacks the two bodies to pieces. Lucy is declared insane and sent to an asylum, where she endures traumatic shock treatments for her mental breakdown.The narrator of the flashback is revealed to be Carol, now a young woman. It is twenty years later, and Carol is opening up about her past to her boyfriend, Michael Fields. After Lucy's incarceration, Carol was taken in by her aunt and uncle, Bill and Emily, and the family lives on a farm in a rural location. Carol is revealing the family history to Michael because Lucy is being released from the asylum, and is coming to live with the family. When Lucy arrives, she is skittish. She cautiously acclimates to the farm, exploring the area with Carol and meeting the gritty-looking farm hand, Krause. But she is clearly thrilled to see Carol again, and is touched by the lovely young woman Carol has become. Carol is a sculptress and has a spacious studio filled with her work, and she thrills Lucy by giving her a bust of herself just as she was in her youth.Things quickly start to get strange. Carol shocks Lucy by presenting her with two bracelets she used to wear when she was a young woman, large dangling charm bracelets that jangle when she walks. Carol seems intent on recreating Lucy as a young woman, taking her clothes shopping and buying her a wig that mimics the hairstyle she wore the last time Carol saw her. Lucy is uncomfortable with this, but agrees to dress this way to please her daughter, whom she desperately wants to make amends with. While they are in the wig shop, Lucy hears strange voices, as if children are singing a morbid nursery rhyme about her crimes. She dismisses it as nerves. Later, she suffers a terrible nightmare and wakes up to discover two bloody heads in bed with her, with a bloody axe lying nearby. When she wakes the others, the items are gone from her room. Lucy starts to think she is relapsing.Things get worse when Carol attempts to introduce Michael to her mother.

When the doctor gets Lucy alone, his comments upset her and she runs off. As Dr. Anderson searches for her around the farm, he enters the darkened barn and a shadowy figure corners him--it appears to be Lucy, the silhouette revealing her hairstyle and figure, right down to the jangling bracelets she wears. The figure is holding an axe, and quickly decapitates Dr. Anderson.Carol returns to the farmhouse to find her mother alone in the darkened living room. The doctor's car is still outside, and Carol quickly comes to the conclusion that her mother has killed him. In a panic, Carol drives the doctor's car into a barn and locks it in, but she is spotted by Krause, who is lurking the shadows. The next day, Carol sees Krause painting the car a different color and angrily confronts him, but he smugly suggests that he knows what happened to the doctor, and that he'll turn Lucy in to the authorities if Carol fires him. Lucy overhears the conversation from the window. Later that evening, Krause is stalked and murdered with the axe.Lucy prepares for an evening that she dreads, a dinner party intended to introduce her to Michael's parents. If Michael and Carol are to be married, these will be their in-laws, and Michael's family is very wealthy, his father being the proprietor of a very successful dairy farm. Lucy has a panic attack in the powder room while at the Fields'--after spilling coffee on her dress, she retreats to the washroom and suffers a flashback because of the wallpaper, which resembles the bars of a prison cell. Carol calms her down and takes her back to the party. Mr. & Mrs. Fields are cordial until they plot to get Lucy alone so they can have a private conversation with her: Mrs. Fields is suspicious of Lucy, and poor Lucy makes a terrible misstep by revealing to Mr. & Mrs. Fields that her daughter and Michael are planning to be married. The Fields had not been informed of this yet, and they react disapprovingly. Mrs. Fields in particular gets very haughty with Lucy, making suggestions about her past, and Lucy suddenly snaps at her, revealing that she was in an asylum for twenty years. She says that under no circumstances will she allow the Fields' to interfere with her daughter's happiness, and she storms out of the house.Michael drives Emily and Carol back to their house while he and Bill go out looking for Lucy, who has disappeared. Emily sends Carol to bed, but Carol is restless and cannot sleep. With Michael gone from the Fields' house, Mr. and Mrs. Fields are alone in their house and they hear sounds to suggest someone is prowling around. Mr. Fields is oblivious, but when he goes into his closet to get undressed for the evening, he is attacked by the figure of Lucy, brandishing an axe. Mrs. Fields becomes suspicious and goes looking for her husband, eventually finding his body in the dressing room. Horrified, she retreats, only to be confronted by the figure of Lucy in the bedroom. Before the axe can fall, the bedroom door opens and the real Lucy comes in; after scuffling with the other figure, Lucy tears off a mask to reveal her daughter's face underneath. Carol has been committing the murders while dressing as her mother; scarred by witnessing the double homicide committed by her mother, Carol's mind was unstable ever since. Certain that Mr. and Mrs. Fields would never allow Michael to marry her without a great deal of trouble, she plotted to make it appear as if Lucy murdered them in a rage, which would send Lucy back to the asylum and allow her to marry Michael. Her mind shattered, Carol clutches the mask of her mother and screams at it \"\"I hate you! I hate you! Oh I'm sorry","I love you! I hate you! I love you!\"\" Outside on the porch",Lucy hears her daughter's insane ravings and weeps,perhaps remembering her own moment of insanity.An epilogue reveals Lucy discussing her plans with Bill.

La mujer no presta atención, y murmura que seguro que él ha perdido todo el dinero.De regreso a la casa, Dany sale corriendo por la finca. Eloísa sale corriendo detrás de él, casi parece presa del pánico. Bernardo, que está limpiando un pequeño estanque de ramas podridas y animales muertos, lo sujeta. Eloísa le dice que no se pase, que le está haciendo daño, a lo que Bernardo responde que debería vigilarolo más y no dejarlo salir de la casa. Eloísa bate la comida y también le pone la comida al perro, y deja todos los cacharros en el fregadero para fregar más tarde. Mientras los perros comen, Eloísa se corta las uñas de los pies y se pinta las uñas; Bernardo toca el piano y se pone una de las cremas del perro en el pie. a Eloísa eso le parece asqueroso, pero él le dice que si a Dany le viene bien, a él también le funcionará.Más tarde, con todo desordenado, Dany se pone a alisquear la ropa interior usada de Eloísa. Eloísa y Bernardo se están vistiendo para ir a visitar a la tía Lina. Bernardo no quiere cambiar la hora de la visita, pero tampoco quiere ir a verla. Eloísa comenta que necesitan el dinero de Lina para vivir. Eloísa detecta un parásito en Dany, y Bernardo se lo quita con unas pinzas de depilar.

Bernardo sigue limpiando la piscina, ahora medio vacía, y para ello usa un cuadro viejo.En el cine, Bernardo y Eloísa ven una película en la que aparecen muchos perros. Al acabar, un presentador habla de una nueva urbanización que está proyectada para que vivan perros. Dos ejecutivos (Carlos Martos y Miguel Avilés) intentan vender la idea a los inversores, gente que parece de clase media. A la salida, unas azafatas reparten panfletos. Eloísa estaría encantada de contribuir al proyecto, pero no tiene dinero. El veterinario, el doctor Alberto Agal (Cruz Tobar) pregunta a Eloísa por la salud de Dany, y le recomienda que le haga comer verduras, pero ella dice que no las traga.De regreso a casa, Eloísa y Bernardo tienen una bronca, porque ella les daría dinero para que llevasen a cabo el proyecto si lo tuviese, mientras que Bernardo piensa que todo son tonterías. En la bronca, se deduce que no son un matrimonio, sino hermanos, - nacidos de la misma madre. Bernardo se cabrea tanto que decide andar el resto del camino, a pesar del frío. Ve unos perros en una casa que le gruñen, y él se entretiene chasqueándoles los dedos, hasta que la gente de la casa se despierta y va a ver que pasa. Por el camino también se encuentra a unos perros abandonados que están comiendo los restos de la basura; improvisa un collar a uno de ellos y se lo lleva. Mientras Eloísa ya está en casa, calmando a Dany porque una tormenta ha estallado, Bernardo vuelve andando y se va empapando. Desde su ventana, Eloísa ve a Bernardo - que se protege con un plástico - y al nuevo perro. Bernardo tiene que tirar de él para hacerle andar. Se oye ladrar al nuevo perro, pero no se ve qué pasa. Mientras tanto, Eloísa se unta miel en su sexo y atrae a Dany hacia ella.Más tarde, Bernardo bebe, ya sin que se vea al nuevo perro, y mientras tanto, Eloísa está sientiendo placer sexual por las caricias de Dany, supuestamente al lamerle la miel. Bernardo oye sus gemidos y se mete en la habitación de al lado. Dany duerme con Eloísa, que lo abraza.Al día siguiente, Bernardo toca el piano mientras Eloísa le corta las uñas a Dany. Operan a la tía Lina de urgencia, aunque es difícil saber si se salvará. A Eloísa le asustan los cambios, pero su hermano sólo se preocupa de donde van a ir a cenar.Bernardo va a buscar a otro perro a un criadero o a la perrera municipal. Escoge lo que parece un mastín negro, y lo encierra en el maletero.Corte a un sacerdote (Buenaventura Martínez), que está bendiciendo al cuerpo de Lina, ya en un ataud. Durante la bendición, se oye los gemiditos que lanza Dany, a quien Eloísa ha colado en la iglesia metido en un bolso de mano.El agua de la piscina parece ahora más limpia; las cacerolas roñosas han dejado sitio a una olla exprés reluciente; la batidora es nueva y moderna; todo parece más limpio; la montaña de platos nuevos y relucientes, de porcelana, antes no estaba; Bernardo viste con un conjunto de pantalones cortos de tenis nuevos; hasta hay más cantidad de carne para Dany: se nota que han cobrado la herencia de la tía Lina. Vestida con un traje más elegante, Eloísa se mete en un coche recién comprado con elevalunas eléctrico. Eloísa deja a Dany sujeto a un palo en el jardín para que el cesped amortigüe el dolor de las patitas. Dany mete el perro dentro de la casa, donde se le escapa, ante la mirada del nuevo criado de la casa. Mientras va a buscarlo, Bernardo dice que a Dany no le gusta quedarse a solas con él.Como Bernardo tiene ahora su propio coche nuevo, coge a Dany y se van los dos. Sin embargo, le chilla, gritando que antes él estaba mejor y más cómodo. Bernardo dice que él también quiere a Eloísa, pero que ella lo prefiere a Dany. Tanto él como su hermana han ido a buscar más perros. Un domesticador alemán (Werner Delil) enseña lo muy educados que están sus perros. Carmen (Marta Molins) le prepara tres cachorros a Eloísa, mientras que su empleado (Francisco Rodríguez) se pregunta qué demonios hacen con tantos perros. La señora Carmen le dice que no haga preguntas.Eloísa lleva a los cachorritos a la cocina: dice a su hermano que no quiere perros de la perrera porque podrían pasarles cualquier enfermedad. Bernardo se ha comprado una caja de ritmos en lugar del viejo piano. Se supone que Eloísa mata y cocina a los perros. Esa tarde-noche, Alberto viene a cenar con ellos, invitado, y dice que Eloísa cada vez cocina mejor. Dany come con ellos a la mesa. Alberto les explica cómo va el proyecto en el que han invertido tanto dinero, pero Bernardo se levanta, diciendo que no tiene apetito y que no se encuentra bien. Ahora tienen hasta un pequeño cien en casa, y la nevera vuelve a estar abarrotada de carne cruda. Mientras los demás se quedan ablando en la sobremesa, Bernardo sale en la noche a la perrera a coger algún perro, y de hecho vuelve con un perro nuevo a casa.Al llegar, ve a Eloísa ofreciéndose a Alberto, y a éste meterle mano a ella, que al finay al cabo está mucho más arreglada y mejor vestida. Alberto se va, quedando con ellos al día siguiente a las 11 de la mañana. Después, los hermanos discuten. Eloísa quiere hacer una visita de obras con Alberto, pero Bernardo, cada vez bebiendo más, se niega a ir. Bernardo destroza un pastel de bodas sin empezar que había en la casa - ni idea de por qué - y luego se va a vomitar al jardín, ahora mucho más arreglado y el césped igualadísimo. Eloísa se toma una pastilla para dormir y obliga a Dany a tomar otra.Eloísa y Alberto visitan el cementerio de perros. Los ejecutivos son también amables con ella al saber que es una de las accionistas. Alberto le regala la tumba para Dany en el futuro. Bernardo no se comunica con nadie, enfurruñado. Una réplica cutre del retrato de la duquesa de Alba que antes estaba en la casa de Lina está ahora en la habitación de Eloísa. Ella lleva a Dany a la ópera, mientras que Bernardo sigue enfurruñado. Alberto recomienda a Eloísa que se separe un poco de él cuando ella le dice que está celoso de él y del perro.Bernardo se ha ido y está acariciando a un perro. Cuando su hermana llega a casa, como de costumbre él no oye como lo llama. Su hermana entra y lo descubre penetrando sexualmente al perro, al que le ha atado las patas. A pesar de los gritos de su hermana, no pasa, así que ella acaba golpeándole con un palo. Se caen los dos al suelo y él parece desmayarse. Eloísa llora sobre su pecho y le dice que no pueden seguir así. Poco a poco, él parece reaccionar. Sin embargo, sigue teniendo temblores, o un ataque de algún tipo. Eloísa le da una de sus pastillas a su hermano, pero éste no quiere tomarla; tampoco quiere ver a Dany, lo que aún hace llorar más a Eloísa. Esa noche, Eloísa duerme en un sofá con el caniche en sus rodillas.Esa noche, Bernardo se levanta y le mete la cabeza entre las piernas a Eloísa. Cuando ella se despierta, a él le da otro ataque. Al final, ella llama a Alberto, pero no está en casa. Sin embargo, Bernardo da andado por su propio pie, aunque en un estado febril. Acorrala a Dany en la cocina, y cuando la dueña lo busca, lo encuentra aterrorizado, escondido en un rincón. Bernardo anda como sonámbulo por el jardín de la casa, mientras que Dani se queda encerrado en el baño y con la bañera echando agua. Bernardo se dedica a jugar al escondite y Dany intenta buscar una salida, ya que Eloísa lo ha dejado encerrado en el baño. El perro grande ladra, lo que atrae la atención de Eloísa. Febrilmente, Bernardo se está comportando con un perro, pero cuando su hermana se le acerca, intenta tener relaciones sexuales con ella. Ella llora, aunque hay momentos en que llama por su nombre a su hermano, y otras, a su perro.El caniche sigue dando vueltas y vueltas intentando salir. El teléfono suena, pero entre los ladridos del perro, la bomba del agua, ni Bernardo ni Eloísa lo oyen. Él la penetra por detrás.Al día siguiente, muy de mañana, Alberto se decide a visitarlos. Nadie le abre la verja, ´pero se oyen los ladridos del perro grande a lo lejos, así que se la salta y entra en la casa. Abre la puerta a Dany, que sale corriendo de la casa y su finca. Guiado por los ladridos del perro grande, aún atado a una estantería, Alberto se encuentra a los dos hermanos dormidos uno al lado del otro, alla medio desnuda. Hay sangre por todas partes, y ella parece muerta. El perro grande sigue ladrando.Alberto sale de la casa, se mete en el coche y se va.Primer plando de la piscina, ahora relucientemente limpia, y del cielo azul.Tráfico en una calle de Madrid.

Over the Edge,1979,95,Drama,7.3,Jonathan Kaplan,Charles S. Haas,Vincent Spano,Michael Eric Kramer,Harry Northup,Andy Romano,"Carl (Michael Kramer) and his friends, Ritchie (Matt Dillon), Claude (Tom Fergus), and Johnny (Tiger Thompson) are hanging out at The Rec, a recreation center for the kids in New Grenada, a planned community full of condominiums and town homes. The Rec is pretty much the only thing in town for the children, as the Homeowners Association totally forgot about the fact that nearly 25% of the population of New Grenada is under the age of 15. So, naturally, the kids find themselves some other ways to have fun; sex, drugs, alcohol, vandalism, and rock n roll. One of the first scenes shown is Mark Perry (Vincent Spano), and his friend shooting his B.B. gun at oncoming cars on the overpass. However, when they hit a police cruiser, they laugh and cheer, and decide to leave before the cop sees them. They hop on their bikes, and ride down the road, passing Carl and Ritchie, who, when warned by the boys about cops, dive into the weeds behind an electric control box. The police car pulls up, and out steps Sgt. Doberman (Harry Northup), the most hated cop in town. He sees the boys, and, upon frisking them, finds a three-inch pocketknife on Ritchie. He take the boys to the station, and calls Carl's father, Fred Willat (Andy Romano), warning him about Carl's behavior.Fred is the local Cadillac salesman, an upper middle class job. Before getting Doberman's call, is talking to Jerry Cole (Richard Jamison), president of the Homeowners Association, about getting Mr. Sloan (Lane Smith), a wealthy Texas Landowner, to come to see the land across the street from The Rec, with hopes of building an industrial park there. Back at the police station, Doberman is questioning Ritchie and Carl about who had the gun, and Ritchie tells them that he has only 1 law; A kid who tells on another kid is a dead kid. Ritchie is then taken out of the room, and Doberman continues lecturing Carl about where hes going to end up if he keeps this up; The Hill, a correction center for the kids in the area. Then Carl and his father drive home, where Sandra Willat (Ellen Geer), waits. But instead of talking to his mother, Carl runs upstairs, and locks himself in his room, blaring the Cheap Trick.The next day at school, Carl and Ritchie tell Claude about their escapades with the police, and Claude announces that he took speed to prepare for the upcoming test. He then looks at a slide of a painting, and instead of seeing the actual painting he sees this mangled, horrid thing. Then they go to an assembly about the recent vandalism on the highway, where Carl gets a look at the love of his life, Cory (Pamela Ludwig), who hes absolutely crazy about. Later, after school, Carl is getting dressed to go out, once again listening to his music, only this time, its The Ramones. When Carl is dressed, he goes downstairs and asks his father about the land across from The Rec. but, upon getting an answer different from what he wanted, leaves for The Rec.The Rec closes at six o'clock p.m., but that doesn't stop the kids from having fun. The kids bring pot, music, and alcohol to The Rec after hours, and have their own little party, where Claude ends up buying a gram of hash from Tip (Eric Lalich), a friend. But the party moves when an announcement about a party at a boys house is made. The party is your basic teens; sex, drugs, beer, and Van Halen. Carl sees Cory on the couch making out with Mark, the boy who shot the cop car, and got Carl and Ritchie busted. Mark then warns Carl about mentioning his name to the cops, and when Carl gives a sarcastic remark, he leaves. Carl gets upset with Cory, telling her that she could do a lot better than Mark. Carl then leaves, followed (unknowingly) by Mark and his friend. While Carl is walking home alone, they jump him, beat him up, and take his money. When Carl gets home, he tries to avoid his parents seeing the cuts and bruises, but fails. Carl gets questioned, but, when refusing to tell them who jumped him, runs upstairs and locks himself in his room. Fred and Jerry Cole then talk about making sure The Rec is closed the next day, when Sloan comes to visit.The next day at The Rec, everyone is talking about Carl's event. But he only releases the names to Claude, Ritchie, Johnny, and Alan (Brian Parker), another friend of theirs. While they're talking, Julia (Julia Pomeroy), The Rec counselor, goes outside to talk to Doberman about The Rec staying open. Doberman goes inside and searches Claude, finding the gram of hash in his pocket, and taking him in. However, when they walk outside, Ritchie is standing on the cop car, and makes the cops chase him around the grounds. When the cops finally leave, Carl, and Ritchie go to get sodas, where Ritchie gives Carl firecrackers. They then get on their bikes and ride around the neighborhood, where they find Cory and her best friend Abby (Kim Kliner) running out of a house, carrying a plastic bag. They stop them, and grab the bag, finding a gun in it, which the girls stole from the house. They then all go to a half-finished town home, which Carl and Ritchie call their condo. After planning a picnic with a gun Cory gets up and starts dancing, with the gun in her hand, pointing it at Carl playfully. But the gun goes off, and Carl scares everyone into thinking he is shot. The group then goes their separate ways. When Carl gets home, he sees Sloan's car in the driveway, and, upset at his father, places the firecrackers given to him by Ritchie in the cars engine, so that when the car is turned on, they will light. Sloan and his boys, scared, then leave, but not before warning Fred that if he doesn't stop to listen to his son, it will come back to bite him.The next day, Carl calls Claude and Johnny, telling them to come to the picnic. They all show up, and after shooting the gun, and realizing that Carl is the only one with any sense of aim at all, they start walking. During the walk, Claude tells them that it was Tip who sold him the hash, and Cory announces that Tip had recently gotten busted for possession. They then decide to pay Tip a visit, and while the boys hold Tip down and interrogate him, the girls ransack his kitchen. Tip tells them that he told Doberman who he sold the hash to, because he was arrested. Ritchie then points the gun at him, and Johnny lights a firecracker, making a gun sound. Before leaving, the boys throw Tip in the water under his porch. Before Cory and Abby leave Carl and Ritchie, Cory runs over to Carl and gives him a kiss, showing him that she likes him as much as he likes her.When Carl gets home, he is told by his mother and father that he is forbidden to see Claude or Ritchie any longer, and that The Rec will be closed. Carl gets in a fight with his father, and when Carl takes a swing at him, he smacks him across the face, causing him to, once again, lock himself in his room. The next day at school, in science class, Carl sees Tips mother (Irene Lalich), and the schools principal (Molly McCarthy) talking in a connected classroom. Tips mother tells the principal the names of the boys that assaulted her son, and this causes Carl to snap. He then grabs Ritchie in the hallway and they run home. Ritchie grabs his gun, and they steal his mothers car, leaving town. However, Doberman sees them leave, and chases them. During the chase, Carl begs Ritchie to throw the gun out of the car, but he refuses. The car then gets flipped over, the two boys running in opposite directions. Ritchie points the gun at Doberman, who mistakes it for loaded, so Doberman shoots and kills Ritchie. Carl then runs away to his condo, but not before calling Johnny to confirm that Ritchie is really dead, and calling Cory to tell her to meet him. She brings a sleeping bag, and they spend the night together. After Cory leaves in the morning, Carl runs home to grab money, and along the way he sees Mark riding his dirt bike. He takes Marks B.B. gun, and shoots him in the shoulder (not harming him), causing him to flip over his bike. Mark then sits down with Carl, talking about what they're going to do about the parent situation. They then decide that their fight was stupid, and they make up. Then Carl goes home, and upon climbing into the house through an upstairs window, he sees his mother on the phone with his father about a big meeting at the school that night, to talk about the new trend of violence with the children. He then locks himself in his mothers room, and gets on the phone, asking his parents if they wish he got shot, too.After leaving his home that night, Carl goes to The Rec, where, all of his friends are. They then make a plan to show the parents that they need to listen to them; lock them in the schools auditorium, and wreck the school. Carl climbs onto the roof, entering the school through a sun window above a science classroom. The kids then take their bike chains and lock the gates surrounding the auditorium. The children decide that the only thing that will make them feel better is to trash the school, and all of the cars in the parking lot. However, when they find guns, all hell breaks loose. The kids run around shooting cars, causing massive explosions. When Cory almost gets blown up by an explosion caused by Mark, and cant find Carl, Claude and Johnny agree to take her home, but not before Johnny gives a phone to Julia, who is sitting by a gate in the school. Julia calls the police, and as soon as they hear sirens, all of the kids split, some getting arrested. The police unlock the auditorium doors, and Doberman runs out to find Carl. He gets in a cop car, and drives down the road until he finds Carl. He handcuffs him to the backseat, and tells him that he will have to go to The Hill. But, Mark is waiting down the road with his B.B. gun, and shoots the car, causing Doberman to run it off the road, into, of all buildings, The Rec. Doberman gets knocked out, and The Rec catches on fire. Carl grabs Dobermans keys, and unlocks himself from the car. He runs away, and stops and turns around just in time to see The Rec blow up. He then for sure knows that Doberman died.The final scene shows Carl in the morning, coming handcuffed out of the police station. Carl stops and hugs his parents, and is then escorted onto a bus (full of other kids involved with the school incident, including Mark and Abby) by Lincoln (Mike Osborne), another police officer. He is sat at the back of the bus, and driven down the highway to The Hill. But, when they go under the overpass, (the same one that Mark was shooting off of earlier) they see Claude, Johnny, and Cory waving from above. Carl then turns around to face the front of the bus, quite content with the fact that his friends are safe, and that Cory still loves him.","cult, violence",train,imdb
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,1980,124,Action,8.7,Irvin Kershner,Leigh Brackett,Anthony Daniels,Mark Hamill,Peter Mayhew,Harrison Ford,"\"In this sequel to the previous Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope, the opening crawl reveals that after the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebels were forced to evacuate their base on the Yavin moon and the dreaded Imperial Fleet of the Galactic Empire has pursued the Rebel Alliance across the galaxy, forcing them to establish a secret base on the remote ice planet Hoth. Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader (David Prowse/voice: James Earl Jones) sends robotic probes in search of the base and its commander and hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).While Luke is patrolling near the base, he sees what looks like a meteor hitting the ground near his location. Before he can ride his mount to the site, he's knocked unconscious by an indigenous, polar bear-like predator, the wampa. Back at the base, the smuggler-pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) announces his intention to leave the Rebels and pay the debt he owes to the gangster Jabba the Hutt, much to the displeasure of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). After Han discovers that Luke has not returned from patrol, he delays his departure and leaves the base to search for him on an ostrich-like creature called a tauntaun.Meanwhile, Luke escapes the wampa's lair, using the Force to retrieve his nearby lightsaber and wounding the beast, but is overcome by the cold outside. He sees an apparition of his late mentor, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), who instructs him to receive training from Jedi Master Yoda (voice: Frank Oz) on the planet Dagobah. Han finds Luke and gives him shelter, using his own tauntaun's carcass to keep Luke warm, until he can build a sturdier shelter. The two are rescued the following morning by a Rebel patrol. Luke is taken to the medical bay to heal from the wounds he received from the wampa. In his recovery room he's met by Leia, Han and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Han jovially reminds Luke that he's rescued him twice from certain danger.Sometime later, when ground scans detect an object outside the base perimeter at Zone 12, Han and Chewie, investigate, and find an Imperial probe droid that transmits the location of the Rebel base to the Imperial fleet before firing upon Chewie and destroying itself. On the bridge of Darth Vader's massive flagship, the droid's transmission is picked up by Captain Piett, but his superior, the fleet Admiral Ozzel, dismisses the message until Vader sees the transmission and realizes it is the Rebel base. He overrules Ozzel and orders the Imperial Fleet to the Hoth system.Later, as the Fleet emerges from hyperspace, Vader is informed by his infantry commander, General Veers, that the Rebels have set up infantry trenches and an energy shield to protect them from the Empire's orbital bombardment. Ordering Veers to launch a surface attack, Vader is furious that Ozzel has clumsily given away the element of surprise by bringing his ship out of light speed too close to the planet, and he communicates this displeasure to Captain Piett as he promotes him on the spot to admiral while Ozzel is given Vader's own fatal brand of reprimand.On the surface, the Imperial forces land their ground assault troops, a unit of over a dozen four-legged AT-AT \"\"walkers\"\" (along with a few dozen two-legged AT-ST walkers) beyond the energy shield and Luke leads his squadron of flying speeders into battle. Realizing that their blasters cannot damage the heavily armored walkers",Luke devises an attack plan that has his squad using their towing cables to bind the legs of the walkers to trip them,making them more vulnerable. A few walkers are destroyed but the Imperial forces eventually overpower the Rebels and destroy the generator powering the energy shield,capturing the Rebel base. Han Solo

At that, Richie, a cocky teenager, stands up and screams Madman Marz, throwing a rock into his old house, smashing a window. Max, annoyed at Richie, ends the campfire, sending everyone to their cabins for the night, while he goes into town to retrieve supplies to help tear down the camp, since it was to end the next day. While they go back to the cabins, Richie sees Madman Marz up in a tree, and goes to see if it's really him. Everyone else gets back to camp, and Max and Dave try to retrieve a felling axe that is placed into a log, but it is stuck. The cook, Dippy, comes out, and wishes them all a good night, before Marz comes in and rips his throat out, and grabs the felling axe out of the log.T.P. tries to get Betsy to go out with him, but she refuses, causing a scene. After the kids have gone to sleep, the rest of the counselors see Max off and go into the rec room to relax. T.P apologizes for being rude to Betsy and she goes with him to have sex in the hot tub, all the while being watched by Madman Marz. After this, Dave is called out to Richie's cabin, and the boys there tell him that Richie never came back, so he goes and informs the others, who are all rejoined up with each other. T.P decides to go and find him, and sets off into the woods, carrying a flashlight. He comes across an opening and calls for Richie, who is busy wandering around the woods looking for Marz. Suddenly, a noose falls over T.P's neck and lifts him up into the air on a tree branch, resulting Marz pulling him down and snapping his neck on impact.Back at the camp, Betsy and Stacy begin to talk about T.P. Stacy believes that T.P only wants sex, and apologized because he knew he would get some, but Betsy thinks he's a nice guy who really likes her. Realizing that it has been a long time since T.P. left, Dave decides to go find T.P and Richie. Dave ventures out into the woods and comes across T.P's hanging body. Panicked, he runs farther into the woods. Marz is behind him with his axe and begins to chase him. Dave finally falls over a fallen tree branch and is decapitated by Marz' axe. Betsy wants to talk to T.P, but finds out that he's still gone and begins to worry. Richie, meanwhile, is still out in the woods, but is now looking for the road back to camp, or someone to take him back. Stacy decides to take the car down to see where everybody is, suspecting that T.P's playing a trick on them. She gets into her car and drives out on the road, towards the woods by the campfire spot, and Marz's house, where we see him run out of. Stacy begins to look around for Dave, T.P, and Richie, but finds nothing, except an abandoned flashlight in the clearing where the two were killed, only T.P's body is now missing. Stacy begins to look around, and sees blood on the trees and starts to panic, running through the woods, until she spots Dave's decapitated body and head laying on the ground. She stifles her screams and rushes back to her car, and tries to drive away, only to have her engine stall. She opens the hood, not recognizing Marz on top of her car, and he jumps onto the car hood, causing it to slam down on Stacy and beheading her.Ellie and Bill have gone to have sex in the woods, leaving a worried Betsy back at camp. When she does not hear any word back, Betsy goes into the woods to find Ellie and Bill. Once she does, she tells them that she has to stay at camp to watch the kids and wait for the others to show up, and that Ellie and Bill should go and try to find them. Ellie and Bill get dressed and take Bill's car out to look for the others, while Betsy goes back to camp. While looking through the woods, Ellie sees Marz at Stacy's car, and begins to scream, causing Marz to flee and Bill come up to see what's wrong. She tells him that she saw Marz at Stacy's car, so both of them go up and decide to drive back to camp. The car doesn't start, having Bill exiting the car to see what's wrong. He sees Stacy's head on the engine, causing him to gag and making Ellie to get out of the car, where she screams and Bill discards the head in a cloth. They get back in the car and hurriedly drive away, only reaching the end of the road, when Bill is pulled from the car window by Marz, causing the car to crash into a tree, and Ellie to fall out of the door and into a ditch. She looks up and watches in horror, as Bill's back snapped by Marz, making her run back to the camp.Betsy is in one of the girl's cabins and does not see Ellie come back and try to find her. Ellie then goes into the kitchen cabin and tries to find Betsy, but with no luck, she goes outside when Marz appears at the door, chasing her through the cabin until she hides in a refrigerator. Once she thinks he leaves, she climbs out and tries to leave, only to have him spring up and hit her with Marz' axe. Betsy finally leaves the cabin and sees Marz running around the campgrounds, causing her to grab a double-barreled shotgun and quietly makes her way to the open-doored kitchen cabin, only to have Ellie at a window, causing her to accidentally shoot her. Realizing that Ellie is dead, she runs and wakes up the kids, telling them to get into the bus they took to get there. They quickly do and she joins them, and begins to drive the bus away from camp, only to have Marz pop up at the door and try to get in. Betsy beats his hand, making him let go and has the oldest boy drive the rest to safety, while she goes to kill Marz and save her friends. She gets out, and follows Marz to his house out in the woods.Once inside she tries not to make any noise, but makes a step creak, causing him to come at her in the darkness, where she shoots him with her shotgun. He snatches it from her during a struggle, when he hits her in the face with his claw nails, ripping her face open. He then drags her towards the basement, while she tries to get away, shoves her up onto a coat hanger poker, She pulls out a hunting knife and stabs him in the shoulder, causing him to knock over a candle. He presumably leaves after having knocked over the candle. The candle begins to burn everything, including the victims he had killed and the skeletons of his wife and two children. The ending shows Max driving back to the camp and almost hitting a shaken Richie, who now says that Madman Marz is real.","grindhouse film, murder, violence, cult, horror, storytelling",val,imdb

The Beastmaster,1982,118,Action,6.2,Don Coscarelli,Don Coscarelli,Marc Singer,Ben Hammer,Rip Torn,Billy Jayne,"The gates to the city of Aruk are raised, and Maax (Rip Torn), high priest of the city's patron god, Ar, rides in with two underling priests. He goes to the central ziggurat that serves as the city's temple, and meets with three witch-women in its interior. The witches appear as shapely women with hideously disfigured faces. The witches tell Maax that he is doomed by a prophecy; he will die at the hands of the son of King Zed (Rod Loomis). Zed's wife is still pregnant with the child, and the prince will grow into a man that will kill Maax. The high priest defies the prophecy and announces that the unborn son will die. Maax sees Ar as a bloodthirsty god who demands the life of Aruk's children in sacrifice, and offering the king's son will prevent the prophecy from coming true.At that moment, King Zed storms into the temple with Seth (John Amos), the captain of the guard, and three other city guards who have swords ready. Zed has heard that Maax intends to offer innocent children in sacrifice to Ar, and he announces he won't allow it. Zed declares that Maax is to be banished from Aruk to dwell in the outlands among the barbarian Juns. When Maax boldly declares that Zed's own son must be cut from his mother, branded with the sign of Ar and sacrificed, Seth advances on Maax, sword at the ready, and King Zed warns Maax that he could have him executed for such talk. Maax looks over both shoulders at his underling priests, who hang themselves. Zed looks on this with only scorn and contempt, and orders Maax removed from the city. Maax is put on a horse and escorted out, passing by an old woman with a cow.This old woman is one of Maax's witch-women in disguise. At night, as Zed and his wife (Vanna Bonta) sleep, the witch creeps into their bedchamber. She pours a foul liquid across their throats, paralyzing them and rendering them mute. Zed and his wife awaken to find the witch focusing on the wife's pregnant abdomen, waving her hands over it. Zed's wife convulses in silent agony as the unborn baby is transferred out of her womb into the cow. Zed can only watch as his beloved wife dies from the violation, and the witch, with a dark cackle, tells him that his unborn son belongs to her, before vanishing.The witch takes the cow out into the fields, and cuts it open, extracting the baby. But as she brands the baby with the symbol of Ar, the dark ritual is seen by a passing traveler who is armed with a sword and a throwing weapon called a kapa. Despite the witch's dark powers, the traveler is able to slay her and rescue the baby. He brings the baby back to his home village of Emir to raise as his own son.The boy is named Dar, and grows into an energetic youth. His father raises and teaches him well. One day, when Dar is a youth, he and his father are practicing swordplay. His father demonstrates how to throw the kapa, and, as a prank, uses it to pluck off the headwrap of a villager named Tiis. The kapa lodges in a tree that Tiis is near, and Dar and his father laugh. But Dar stops laughing as he sees a rustle in the tree line, and then urgently tells his father to run. As Tiis tries to retrieve his headwrap, something concealed by the tree line yanks him out of view, and there are sounds of growling before Tiis is hurled back out. A huge bear has grabbed Tiis and mauled him to death, and it emerges from the tree line toward Dar and his father. Dar's father loses his balance and twists his ankle. He yells at Dar to run and save himself. But Dar slowly walks toward the bear, continuing to stare at it. Dar's father watches in wonder as the bear quietly sinks back down to all fours and turns, walking away. They can do nothing for Tiis, but Dar's father sees that his adopted son has very curious powers neither of them understand; he can touch the mind of a beast. He holds Dar's hand, where the brand is still visible, and tells him that the gods have put their mark on him, and it will be his guide until he finds out why.More years pass, and Dar is a tall, handsome, strapping man (now played by Marc Singer). Dar takes his dog, Todo, and goes out with a number of other young village men to work in a field outside the village.As the men work, Dar picks up a stick and smiles at Todo. He throws the stick for Todo to fetch. But on reaching the stick, Todo doesn't return. He stands his ground and begins to bark. At first, Dar just smiles at his pet and companion, but as Todo continues barking, Dar and the other villagers realize the dog is aware of danger. They all run up to where the dog stands. Far in the distance, a great cloud of dust and the rumbling sound of galloping horses, approach Emir; a band of marauding Jun barbarians.Dar's father and a few other village elders draw their swords and stand at the village perimeter as the Jun horde approaches, but they are quickly overrun by the mounted barbarians. By the time Dar and the village men arrive, the barbarians are attacking everyone and setting the village on fire. The terrified villagers all fight with desperation. Dar manages to grab up a sword and, picking out the Jun leader (Tony Epper), charges toward him. Another Jun barbarian comes riding up behind Dar and clubs him from behind with a flail, knocking him unconscious. The Juns proceed to slaughter all of the villages, women and children included, and even Todo, as he tries to drag Dar to safety, is hit by a crossbow bolt loosed by one of the Juns. As the Juns finish their work, Maax rides up to the village with a number of priests and flashes a terrible smile. Looking pleased, he fails to notice Dar laying on the ground just a few feet in front of his horse; the brand of Ar on his palm. Todo grabs Dar by his clothing again and resumes pulling him away.Dar slowly awakens, becoming aware of the land rushing past him as if he were a great avian in flight. He blinks, and hie eyesight refocuses and returns. He sits up and sees Todo lying near him, a crossbow bolt protruding from his side. Todo had managed to drag him to safety before collaping and dying from his wound. Dar walks in a daze among the ruins of his village; the corpses of many of the villagers have been impaled on the village's wooden beams. Perched on one of the perimeter beams is a great brown eagle. Dar locks eyes with the raptor, the two looking close at each other for a couple of moments.Dar discards his upper garment and pulls a leather gauntlet over his hand to hide the brand. He arranges all the slain villagers in a circular formation, laying Todo across the body of Dar's father, with the father's arm placed around Todo's neck. Dar burns the bodies and takes his father's sword and throwing kapa. He remembers his father's words about the mark on his hand being his guide, and that if anything happened to the father, Dar should look for their enemies, the Juns, and seek his destiny in the valley of Aruk.As Dar begins walking away from the ruins of Emir, he passes by the eagle again. Once more they lock eyes, and Dar forges a bond with the eagle, and it begins to follow him as a companion. (NOTE: though Dar never speaks a name for the eagle, we learn in the two Beastmaster sequels that the eagle was named Sherak, so that name will be used in this synopsis for the sake of uniformity).Dar runs through a shallow stream toward his clothing after having bathed. As he is dressing, two ferrets come creeping through the brush. Dar turns in surprise as the ferrets grab hold of his leather skirt and begin running off with it. Dar chases them, losing sight of them in the brush, and takes a wrong turn, tumbling from a cliff and landing in quicksand. The ferrets, curious, crawl along an overhanging branch of a tree. Dar cannot reach the branch himself, and tells the ferrets that since they got him into the situation, they need to help get him out. The little animals, of course, don't understand spoken human speech, but Dar is no ordinary human. He looks up intently at the ferrets, concentrating. One of the ferrets crawls further along the branch, weighing it down, as the other begins gnawing on it. The branch tips down enough for Dar to grab it and pull himself to safety. The ferret who had crawled along the branch, slips off into the quicksand, but Dar is able to pluck it out and rescue it. Dar names the ferrets Kodo and Podo, his newest friends.Dar continues walking as Kodo and Podo ride in his belt pouch. He pauses along a cliff to rest, Sherak landing near him. Dar starts looking around, concerned. He hears the growling of a great feline and sees several mounted Juns chasing a beast, through the eyes of the beast. He sees one of the Juns snare the beast with a heavy rope lasso, and then sees one end of the lasso tied around a heavy wooden stake driven into the ground. Running to investigate, he sees the Juns tormenting a great black tiger they've captured. Taking Kodo and Podo from his pouch, Dar tells them that the tiger should be rescued.Before Dar can throw his kapa, one of the Juns ambushes him from behind, but Dar his fast enough to grab the Jun's arm and throw him over his shoulder. They both tumble down the hillside to the ground where another Jun readies his crossbow. Dar throws his kapa, and the Jun ducks before again aiming his crossbow, but the kapa circles around like a boomerang, hitting the Jun square in the back. As another Jun rides up, crossbow at the ready, Dar gives a high pitched squawking sound toward Sherak and grabs the one he's grappling with, using him as a human shield against the crossbow bolt. Sherak then swoops down on the mounted Jun, clawing at his eyes through the eyeholes in his leather hood, causing him to tumble from his horse. The two wranglers run for their weapons, but Kodo and Podo dart forward, snatching the bolts out of their crossbows. The wranglers grab their swords and run at Dar, who kicks one away and slays the second. Dar then grabs his kapa and hurls it, cutting through the rope lasso and freeing the tiger, who shows the last wrangler what it's like to face him on even terms. As Dar collects his belongings, he pauses, looking at Sherak and the two ferrets, who are his eyes and cunning; and now having befriended the tiger, he has great strength as well. He names the tiger Ruh and sets out again.Dar happens across two beautiful young women, one blonde and one brunette, swimming by a waterfall. He's intrigued and is moved to some mischief in order to introduce himself. He sends Kodo and Podo to snatch an outer garment by the riverbank. The brunette (Tanya Roberts) runs in pursuit, but quickly loses sight of them. Suddenly Ruh comes into view and stands in front of the girl, growling. As she stares at the tiger in fear, Dar grabs her from behind, telling her that they might escape if they show no fear. He then uses his mental link to Ruh to tell him to stand down and move out of sight.Dar tells Kiri she owes him her life, but he'll accept 'this as payment,' and then kisses her. The girl trips Dar to the ground and kneels astride him, demanding to know who he is. Dar tells her his name, and that his village of Emir was destroyed by the Juns, and he's following. The girl thinks this is funny, as Dar is alone. Dar manages to roll over on top of her and asks, in turn, who she is. The girl's necklace slips from her neck as Dar rolls over. She tells him that her name is Kiri, and she's a slave to the temple of Ar's priests. Dar is horrified to find whip marks across her back and shoulders, under her garment, but she reminds him again, that she's a slave. She can't run away because the priests will kill her family. She tells Dar that he should continue following the Juns, because they will at least grant him a death more befitting a strong man, than the priests of Ar would.Retrieving Kiri's dropped necklace, Dar decides to follow her, but he's given her too much of a head start. As he looks around, trying to pick up her trail, he catches an ominous sight: a great, dark tree on a high cliff, with several cocoon-like objects hanging from it.Investigating, Dar finds the cocoon-like objects to seemingly be alive. Also hanging from the tree is a cage with a man in it, and before the base of the tree is a bird-like carving and a cauldron filled with a foul liquid. When a human head suddenly floats to the top of the cauldron, Dar turns away with disgust, and finds himself looking at several humanoids with only eyes, but no noses, mouths, or ears on their heads, and great bat-like wings wrapped around themselves.Dar draws his sword and breaks open the cage, freeing the prisoner, who tries to flee. One of the bat-bird-men unfolds its wings and envelops the prisoner. The man gives horrible muffled screams as a foul liquid pools at the creature's feet. The creature unfolds and opens its wings, and the prisoner's bones, stripped clean of all organic matter, tumble to the ground. Silently the bat-bird-men advance on Dar and Ruh, as Dar holds his sword at the ready. But as Sherak descends and lands on Dar's outstretched wrist, the bird-creatures retreat quickly. They revere birds as gods, and to see an eagle having befriended Dar means he is protected by their gods. Still wary, Dar starts to leave. One of the bird-creatures gives Dar a medallion with a bird symbol on it.Morning comes, and Dar awakens from sleep. Sherak lands nearby with a squawk. Dar understands the eagle sees something, and goes to look; he's arrived at the city of Aruk.The road into Aruk is lined with wooden poles from which hang dessicated humanoid corpses. Dar looks around with a grim expression, and tells Ruh to stay out of sight.The bridge is extended over the city moat, which is filled with tar instead of water. The gate is up. Dar enters the city and finds the streets all but deserted. He finds a robe hung outside one of the huts and dons it. Alerted to the sound of shouting, he makes his way to the great ziggurat which serves as the Temple of Ar.Maax has usurped control of the city and keeps the people in line through fear. He performs regular child sacrifices, that Ar be appeased and continue to protect the city. Dar watches in disgust as Maax holds aloft a baby boy, and casts it into a burning fire at the top of the ziggurat, as the townspeople bow their heads fearfully.Maax announces that Ar is not yet satisfied, and that another child must be sacrificed. He points, and his priests seize a baby girl as town guards restrain her parents, who scream and weep in protest. Dar pushes his way to the front of the crowd until he reaches the perimeter of soldiers, who bar him from moving further. As the girl is carried to the top of the ziggurat, Dar sees a number of slave girls standing along the steps of the ziggurat; Kiri is among them.Sherak circles the sky high above the city as Maax lifts the baby girl and makes offers of sacrifice to Ar. Dar lowers the hood of his robe and concentrates. Maax places the girl into the slope that leads down into the flames. But as the baby girl slides inexorably toward her death, Sherak swoops from the skies with a majestic cry, seizes the child in its talons and flies off with her. All of the townspeople prostrate themselves on the ground in awe, except for Dar. Kiri starts to fall to her knees when she sees Dar and looks at him in wonder.Maax notices, and looks at Dar intently. He doesn't recognize Dar for who he is, but he does understand that he controlled the great eagle. Maax watches the eagle carry the baby girl, and then looks back to where Dar was standing-- but Dar is no longer there. Looking to save face for himself, Maax points after the bird and shouts to the townspeople that Ar has spoken personally to them, saying he wants their children.Nighttime in Aruk. Dar holds a large, bulging sack, and holds Kodo over it, letting the ferret sniff the sack. Dar then sets Kodo on the ground, and it begins to scamper from house to house, looking for more traces of the same scent.The father of the baby girl sits forlornly in his house when there's a knock at the door. His dread turns to curiosity at the sight of Dar, and then to overjoy as Dar produces his daughter from the sack. The father, Sacco (Ralph Strait), pledges his gratitude and service to Dar, offering him anything.Dar decides to ask Sacco about Kiri, though he doesn't say her name; only that she is a friend. Sacco asks Dar into the house, saying he should at least have a meal. At the table, Sacco tells Dar Aruk's story: most of the young men in the city were slain by the Jun horde, which is how Maax overthrew Zed. The king is now imprisoned within the ziggurat while Maax and his witchwomen sit in the seat of power. The remaining townspeople are bred by the Jun priests so their children can be sacrificed by Maax.Dar asks Sacco again about the slave girl, and Sacco says they've been taken back to the temple to prepare them for their own deaths. The Jun horde has gone north, but Maax promises they will return. Thanking Sacco for the meal, Dar assures him that he and his family will see Dar again.Maax's witchwomen have crafted a magical ring for the Jun priests. Maax tells them to find this man, this 'master of the beasts,' and that the ring will lead them to him.Dar and Ruh are tracking the slave girls when Ruh finds a spring trickling from a tree. Taking a drink from the tree, Dar sends Ruh ahead to scout. Hiding in the tree is one of the Jun priests. The stone in the ring is actually the closed lid of an eye. The eye opens and looks on Dar, and Maax and the witchwomen can see what the eye sees, in their cauldron. The eye falls on the mark on Dar's hand, and Maax realizes the man is Zed's son. He tells the priest to kill Dar immediately.The priest snares Dar around the neck with a leather loop as the other priest, on horseback, approaches to kill Dar. But Ruh is also in the tree, above and behind the priest holding the noose. Ruh ambushes the priest, taking him down and killing him. The mounted priest takes off, and Ruh gives pursuit... and falls into a covered pit that the priests prepared for Dar.The priest aims his crossbow to kill Ruh, when he's whacked from behind by a stout wooden staff. Standing there is Seth, with a young boy in his late pre-teens. The priest tries to snare Seth, who blocks the snare with his staff, and knocks the priest into the pit, where he is killed by Ruh. Seth remarks that to face a beast on its own terms, man finds he is not so strong.Dar arrives, and draws his sword at the sight of Seth and the boy, though he does not move to attack. Hearing Ruh roaring, he moves to the pit and looks, seeing Seth saved Ruh rather than trapped him. Voicing his gratitude, Dar moves to a large log, trying unsuccessfully to tip it down into the pit so Ruh can use it to climb out. Seth and the boy help him in this task. Seth introduces himself and his companion, Tal (Joshua Milrad) as 'pilgrims' on their way to worship at the temple of Ar. Understanding what Seth means by worshipping, Dar says he is also on his way to the temple for the same purpose. Seth invites Dar to travel with him and Tal.Over a campfire, Seth tells Dar how he and Tal have spent three years, since fleeing Aruk, trying to raise an army to fight the Juns. As long as Zed lives, he still remains a symbol of hope for those trying to live free of Maax's tyranny. Tal is Zed's son, and meant to free Zed from imprisonment, and one day take the throne. Dar tells how he's always had an uncanny ability to communicate with animals, see through their eyes and hear their thoughts, as they can likewise do with him.Dar lets Tal hold Kodo and Podo, and empties out his pouch, explaining how they steal anything they find of value. Tal picks up the Jun priest's eye-ring, not knowing what it is, and Dar, also unknowing, tells him he can keep it. But also among the items is Kiri's necklace. They see it, and Seth's demeanor turns stern as he demands to know where Dar found it. Despite Seth's protests, Dar insists it came from a slave girl, and Dar is trying to rescue her before she's put to death at the temple. Seth sternly says they leave at dawn, before walking away. Tal and Seth know Kiri-- she's Tal's cousin.At dawn, Dar awakens from sleep and sends Sherak to scout. Dar crouches by a campfire, seeing all that Sherak sees. Tal and Seth awaken and understand what Dar is doing. Through Sherak's eyes, Dar sees five women in white robes surrounded by priests in red. Seth knows this means the slave girls are prepared as sacrifices. He says they must make plans in order to rescue the slave girls.Seth and Dar hijack a barge that the priests must use to cross a great lake. When one of the priests knocks Kiri down after she stumbles, and she kicks him in the groin, the priest grabs her head and pushes it under the water. Dar and Seth ambush the priests, capturing them and rescuing the slave girls. As they begin to depart, more priests arrive, firing crossbows, and Seth realizes the barge is now too heavy to get away. Kiri kicks the prisoner priests overboard and they escape. With a little 'coaxing' from Kiri, Dar agrees to help free Zed. As they begin traveling over land back toward Aruk, Seth sets out to find and rally as many people as he can find, to overthrow Maax and free Aruk. Dar, Tal and Kiri are to meet him in the Taran Valley in two nights.Night time over Aruk; Sacco steps outside his hut and sees Sherak perched nearby. Sacco frets and mutters to himself, protesting that he's a coward. But he knows and still respects his vow to Dar, and rides out in his wagon to smuggle Dar, Tal and Kiri past the guards, into the city. But the eye-ring on Tal's hand reveals their presence to Maax, who decides to prepare a welcome.Sacco tells Dar and Kiri that he'll wait for them on the ziggurat's north side. Tal, Ruh, and the ferrets go with Dar and Kiri into the temple. As Ruh scouts ahead, Dar leads the way through a corridor that looks like a potential trap; along both sides of the wall near the floor, are grated openings into some kind of prison chambers. Dar thinks he sees the glowing of bestial eyes from through the grates. Suddenly, with guttural bestial growls, numerous appendages-- or perhaps humanoid limbs-- encased in leather and wicked steel spikes, thrust through the grates, swiping madly at Dar. Seizing a chain that runs the length of the corridor from the ceiling, Dar manages to cross to the other side, safely out of reach. On the other side is a lever that, when pulled, shuts the grated openings so that Kiri and Tal can cross through as well. Tal tells Dar that those were Death Guards, a monstrosity created by Maax's priests, which explains why there were no soldiers or other guards out front.Pressing forward, they find a grate in the floor of one corridor; Kiri says that the chamber below has the keys to the dungeon cells. In the chamber, Jun Priests are in the process of preparing another death guard. Tal explains how a human man is made into a mindless monster through torture. First, the priests encase his limbs in spiked leather sheaths; spikes capable of ripping a man to pieces. Then a foul green liquid and green leeches are put into his ear canal to severely damage his brain. Finally his head is placed into a hardened leather hood with a frightening visage on the front. Stripped of all thought and reason, a death guard will mindlessly kill anything it sees; anything that moves.As Tal explains the procedure, Kiri quietly goes into a side corridor and turns a wall torch. A portion of the wall opens up into a chamber looking like a hidden armory.Tal sees where the cell keys are; Dar says that stealing is best left to thieves. He places Kodo and Podo in a loop of string, and lowers them carefully through the grate down to steal the keys. But just as the ferrets reach the keys, one priest happens to turn, and sees them.But that's the least of the problems; the death guard awakens, bursts its restraints and slaughters the priests. Its spikes snap the string, causing Kodo and Podo to drop to the floor of the cell. They are able to grab the keys and run into an air vent beside the door, but the death guard breaks the door down and madly pursues the little beasts.Despite Dar's clear concern, he assures Tal that Kodo and Podo are fast and cunning, and can handle themselves. They need to proceed with the rescue.Kiri emerges from the armory, now wearing leather boots and a leather girdle with a dagger tucked into it. Tal explains to Dar what Kiri truly is; a Trov warrior, an ancient sect of protectors for Aruk. The ziggurat used to be their home. Kiri is a skilled tracker, and can find the cell where Zed is imprisoned.Arriving at the cell, they find it unlocked. As Kiri and Tal enter the cell, Dar turns; he senses that Ruh has caught up to them, but hasn't come into sight yet. He cautiously starts toward an intersection... nearly walking into an ambush; when in fact it is the ambushing priest that is about to get ambushed, by Ruh, who kills him. Satisfied, Dar hurries back to the cell where Kiri and Tal are tending to Zed. Zed is now old, gray, haggard and feeble... and blinded by Maax's priests.The door to the cell suddenly closes; through the small grate in the door, Maax and one of the witchwomen are visible. The witch assures Maax that Dar is the one of whom the prophecy spoke, and Maax decrees they will all be sacrificed in the morning. Ruh comes charging down the corridor, and Maax and the witchwoman hurriedly enter the cell, closing the door behind them to keep Ruh out. Maax orders the witchwoman to kill Dar.Dar draws his sword and squares off with the witchwoman, who flicks her fingers and makes a flash that blinds Dar. Tal runs at Maax and tries to hit him with his fists, but the youth is still not grown or strong enough to hurt him. Maax pulls a knife and holds it at Tal's throat to keep Kiri at bay.Hissing malevolently, the witchwoman backs against the wall and begins to slither up it, and onto the ceiling, preparing to drop down on Dar from above. But Ruh can still see through the grate, and while Dar is still blinded, he can see through Ruh's eyes. He thrusts his sword straight up and then turns in a half-circle, killing the witchwoman.In the distraction, Kiri pulls a slim silver chain from a wrist bracer and snares Maax's knife hand, forcing him to drop the knife. Ruh breaks down the cell door and advances threateningly on the high priest, roaring. Knowing he cannot face down the mighty beast while alone and unarmed, Maax drops down into a hidden back corridor and escapes while Tal tends to Zed. The old king is coming to; he's still alive, still aware, and he assures Dar he can walk.Meanwhile, the death guard continues its pursuit of Kodo and Podo. The clever ferrets run through old pipes along the walls, but the death guard is relentless; when they run underneath a gap at the bottom of a closed door, the death guard simply smashes it apart.Kiri leads the group to a chamber at the bottom of the ziggurat. Tal turns a lever that lifts a heavy stone carved into a skull shape, that conceals a stairway out of the temple. Dar tells Ruh to go first, and to protect Tal, Zed and Kiri while he covers their escape. Kiri begs Dar to come with them, as the stairway is the only means of escaping the city, but Dar says he can't leave without Kodo and Podo.Alerted to the sound of banging, Dar returns to the door. Half a dozen Jun priests with long knives are searching for him. Seeing him peering through the door, they charge at him with bloodthirsty yells. Dar closes and bars the door, and cuts the pulley to drop the skull-stone back over the stairway entrance. This door also happens to be where Kodo and Podo are running toward; still hauling the cell keys with them. They run under the feet of the priests and under a gap in the door, and the priests all turn and scream in terror as they see the death guard running straight toward them.Kiri returns as Dar collects Kodo and Podo. Gathering the rope from the pulley, she tells Dar they can use it to escape via the air shaft. The death guard smashes through the door and mindlessly pursues Dar and Kiri through the shaft. As they climb down the cliffside with the aid of the rope, the death guard swipes madly at the rope with its spike-shod arm. Sherak flies at the death guard, clawing at its hooded head with his talons. The death guard leans too far out of the shaft and plunges to its death.The rope breaks and Dar and Kiri fall-- but Sacco is there, and their fall is broken by the soft hay of his wagon. Sacco snaps the reins for the wagon's horse, spurring it into a run toward the city gates; but Maax has put the gate guards on alert and it is closed. Dar asks if the gate has a counterweight; when Kiri tells him that it does, he puts Kodo and Podo in another loop of string and has Sherak carry them up to the top of the gate tower to gnaw through the heavy ropes that control it, so that it will raise.As the ferrets get to work, Dar and Sacco hear the sounds of monstrous growling. Three death guards are running madly toward them, spurred by a mounted Jun priest wielding a whip. Dar tells Sacco to start full speed for the gate; their only hope is to trust that Kodo and Podo will get it open.The guard in the tower turns and notices Podo gnawing the control ropes. Raising his sword, he takes hold of the ferret's tail and repositions it for a killing blow. Seeing this, Kodo creeps under the guard's skirt and delivers a punishing bite right where it will do the most hurt. Screaming, the guard reflexively brings his sword down, cutting the rope the rest of the way so that the gate's counterweight starts to pull it up. Sacco reaches the gate just as it raises enough so that his wagon can pass through. As they reach the gate, Dar swings his sword and cuts the counterweight rope. The death guards try to slide under the gate, but are not fast enough, and it crushes them all beneath it. Kodo and Podo drop down from the top of the wall into the hay of Sacco's wagon, and he rides off.Everyone is gathered together at the Taran Valley. Seth has put together thirty-five warriors. Zed's spirit is still as strong as ever, but he has become far too single-minded in his desire for vengeance, for his own good. When Dar issues a warning that killing Maax and his priests will only incur the wrath of the Jun horde, and more soldiers are needed to counter this, Zed calls him a freak and shouts that he needs no cowards beside him. Zed's rejection hurts Dar badly, and he leaves the camp with Ruh, a tear rolling down his face. Sitting on a rock, Dar scrawls a rough outline of a circle with a line through it; a symbol of his home village of Emir.Kiri comes up to him, though only for a moment's comfort; she is honor-bound to her duty to Zed, and she cannot speak against or defy her uncle and king. She sadly tells Dar that nobody will oppose Zed after he cast Dar out. Zed is more than just a deposed king; he's still the people's symbol of hope.As Kiri returns to camp, Zed is starting to outline a plan of attack on Aruk to defeat Maax. Tal has dozed off, and the eye-ring on his hand opens. Maax flashes an evil grin as he listens to Zed's attack plan.Seth turns, and notices the open eye in the ring. Maax's grin vanishes as the eye turns toward Seth, and it's clear he sees it and understands what it is. Seth grabs a small stick from the campfire and presses it into the eye, putting it out, before pulling the ring off Tal's hand and tossing it into the campfire. He tells Zed that Maax has overheard the whole conversation and knows the attack plan, and will be prepared. But so utterly single-minded is Zed that he cannot see any turn of events other than total defeat and death for Maax. Seth knows better; it is his forces that will face this fate.Dar awakens in the morning; his animal companions at his side. Looking around, he senses trouble. Getting to higher ground, he sees Sacco riding on a horse, leading another. Dar calls out to Sacco, who tells him that the attack on Maax failed; Zed, Tal, Seth and Kiri were all taken alive, and are set to be sacrificed at the temple of Ar at sunset. Dar quickly mounts the second horse and rides with Sacco back to Aruk.At the temple of Ar, Maax and the last surviving witchwoman stand atop the ziggurat as a wagon brings Seth, Tal, and Kiri. All three are dressed in sacrificial robes; their hands tied with leather strips. Kiri is pulled out of the wagon and dragged up to the top of the ziggurat. Beside the sacrificial fire pit, Zed is tied to a chair. Maax tells the people of Aruk that Zed has defied the will of Ar, and now he and his kin will die.Dar rides into Aruk just as the priests drag Kiri to the top of the ziggurat. The crowd quickly parts as he rides straight for the ziggurat. He tosses his pack into the wagon, and Kodo and Podo dart out, chewing through the leather thongs that bind Tal and Seth. Dar storms the ziggurat, attacking any guards or priests in his way. Sacco and the townspeople throw a sword and staff to Seth and Tal, who join in the battle. Ruh leaps at a guard, who drops his weapon and backs against the wall of the ziggurat, screaming in fear before he is mauled to death.Kiri is thrust down onto the ziggurat as she continues to fight. She bites one priest's hand and starts to break free, before she is clubbed on the head with a sword pommel and knocked out. Maax raises his knife to kill Kiri, but the shouts of the townspeople alert him that Dar is almost at the top of the ziggurat, and all of the townspeople themselves are starting to grapple the guards, wrestling them for their spears. The witchwoman tells Maax that he is doomed; the unborn son has come for him.Maax raises his knife again, but Dar is at the top of the ziggurat, starting to cut through the priests. Maax goes to Zed, holding his knife at the king's chest. Dar finishes all of the priests and swings his sword menacingly in front of Maax. Holding the knife, Maax then reveals to both Zed and Dar that they are father and son; Dar is the unborn child stolen from his mother's womb. His eyes wide, Dar puts his sword down on the floor of the ziggurat roof. But despite this, Maax kills Zed with a rake of his knife through the king's chest, and then lunges at Dar, grappling with him. Fighting his way back to his feet, Dar forces Maax's arms around and down, driving Maax's own knife into his stomach.Retrieving his sword, Dar turns to the last witchwoman, who cowers beside a stone urn. As Dar advances on her, the witchwoman turns away. Dar thrusts his sword at her back, but her cloak is empty; Dar sees a white bird flying away. Dar goes to Kiri, who recovers consciousness and smiles at him. Lifting her in his arms, Dar goes to the edge of the ziggurat's top.Seth, Tal, and the townspeople overpower the remaining guards and rush up the ziggurat in triumph. Maax is overthrown. The townspeople cheer in victory.But in fact, though grievously wounded, Maax is still alive. Pulling the knife from his stomach, he struggles to his feet and staggers toward Dar from behind, intent on killing him.Kodo and Podo have scampered up the ziggurat and reached the top. Maax is almost on top of Dar, who remains unaware of the high priest. Kodo doesn't think twice. Leaping as high as he can, the ferret lands on Maax's shoulder, biting his neck. Maax screams in agony, clutching at Kodo-- and loses his balance, tumbling into the sacrificial fire, taking Kodo with him. Shouting in desperation, Dar darts toward the fire, but cannot reach into it. Kodo is lost. Podo peers sadly into the fire at the loss of its mate before Dar picks the ferret up and holds it against his chest.From his vantage point, Tal sees something on the horizon. A huge dust cloud is moving slowly but inexorably toward Aruk. As Maax had foretold, the Jun horde has returned to Aruk. Seth tells Tal that it's his decision on whether to fight or flee. Tal looks at Dar. Holding Podo close against him, Dar tells the people that it's time to stand and fight.Preparations are made with speed. The bridge is pulled back, and the townspeople furiously shovel dirt over the moat to cover it so that it appears as solid ground. Meanwhile, Dar sits on the steps of the ziggurat. He pulls out the medallion given to him by the bat-bird-men and looks at it. Calling to Sherak, Dar tosses the medallion to the eagle and sends him to the great tree to summon aid.It is night time. The townspeople anxiously wait the arrival of the Juns. As the rumbling of the horde's horses grows louder, Dar mentions to Seth that tar was a rite of manhood and test of strength in Emir. Hopefully the Juns will fail.The Jun horde rides into view, stopping a few dozen yards short of the wall. The people of Aruk and the Jun barbarians stare each other down in a tension filled moment. Then the Jun leader silently raises his massive greatclub and points toward the town, signaling the Juns to attack. The Juns ride forward, slaughter on their minds. Seth's plan pays off as the Juns ride straight into the moat; their horses falling into the tar. The people of Aruk cheer. A lookout just in front of the gate lights a torch and runs to light the moat aflame.But although mired in tar, the Juns are far from down. They begin loosing bolts from their crossbows, taking down the lookout and a sentry perched atop the town gate. Tal runs to the fallen lookout, grabbing his torch, only to be wounded by another crossbow bolt. The wounded sentry manages to release the gate controls to close the gate. Dar and Kiri roll underneath and clear before it closes. As Kiri tends to Tal, a Jun barbarian climbs out of the tar and advances on her, sword raised to cleave her in two. Kiri grabs the torch and thrusts it at the Jun, setting him aflame. Dar runs at the burning barbarian and kicks him back into the tar moat. Sheets of flame roar out across the moat as the tar is ignited. Seth climbs over the gate, joining with Dar and Kiri.More Jun barbarians crawl out of the burning moat; some still riding on horseback. Dar, Kiri and Seth fight with all their fury and strength, taking down several Juns. But still more crawl out of the moat and surround them on all sides, driving the three until they are back to back to back. The Juns fence and poke at them with their swords, looking for openings.The Jun leader spurs his horse, leaping over the burning moat and into the fray. The Jun soldiers part way for him, Pointing his massive greatclub, the Jun leader challenges Dar to single combat. The Jun leader's greatclub has two small blades at the heavy end protruding to either side, and he can detach the pommel to swing the weapon as a flail. He bashes downward and the blade gets stuck in the bridge. Drawing a sword, he picks up the fight. Leaping off the bridge, Dar tackles the Jun leader off his horse and retrieves his sword. Their blades clash and the Jun leader grapples with Dar, slamming him against the bridge so that his sword goes flying, and then throwing him to the ground and retrieving his greatclub. The Jun leader whirls the massive greatclub around by the pommel and chain, again bashing downward, and again one blade lodges in the bridge. Dar stuns the Jun leader with several kicks and grabs the Jun leader's legs, taking them out from under him. As the Jun leader falls, the other blade of his greatclub lodges in his back. The wounded leader struggles to his feet, but Dar looses a swinging round kick to his helmeted head, knocking him down, and then grabs his arm, using it to fling the Jun leader into the flaming tar.Recovering his sword, Dar makes his way back into the circle, back to back to back with Seth and Kiri. The remaining barbarians seem ready to descend on the trio and finish what their fallen leader started. Enough Juns remain that the death of Dar, Kiri and Seth seems certain, no matter how many Juns they take with them.Sherak swoops down, landing on Dar's arm. The rustle of wings signals the arrival of the bat-bird-men. Opening their massive wings, they each envelop a Jun barbarian, devouring their victim. The bat-bird-men rout the remaining Juns; a scant few barbarian survivors fleeing. The leader of the avian humanoids looks at Dar, giving him a small nod before leading his own people back home. The gate is raised and Dar, Seth and Kiri pull a wounded Tal back into the city. The people of Aruk cheer in victory.Some time later, Dar is preparing to leave Aruk. Tal is healing well, although one of his arms will be weak and difficult to use for some time. Dar gives something wrapped in leather to Seth, as a gift to the new king.Seth suddenly grabs Dar's hand, looking closely at the mark there. The brand is a rough likeness of the front face of the temple ziggurat. Having been there when Maax made the pronouncement, Seth knows what the mark means. He tells Dar that he is the rightful king, as firstborn.But Dar has not led a life appropriate to a future ruler. He can't be tied down to a throne. He is sure that Tal will be a great leader, for he already has the best right hand that one could ask for. Dar and Seth clasp forearms in farewell. A number of villagers watch as Dar and Ruh walk side by side toward the gate. As the two pass through the open gate and out of Aruk, Kiri is seen running after Dar.Tal takes the gift Dar left him to the ziggurat temple. Wrapped in the piece of leather is Dar's throwing kapa.Sherak is perched on a totem atop the ziggurat. Seth comes up beside Tal, and the two of them, and Sherak, all look into each other's eyes for a brief moment, before the eagle takes flight again, to rejoin his master.As Dar stands on a high bluff, Kiri comes up behind him. Whether she is bidding him farewell or choosing to go with him is left for the viewer to decide. Kiri kisses Dar passionately as Podo pokes its head out of Dar's belt pouch, sniffing noses with Ruh. Two baby ferrets borne by Podo follow suit. The last shot is Kiri and Dar kissing, from Sherak's birds-eye view as he circles high above.",cult,train,imdb

Tank,1984,113,Action,5.7,Marvin J. Chomsky,Dan Gordon,Sandy Ward,G.D. Spradlin,James Garner,Dorian Harewood,"\"Sergeant Major Zack Carey (James Garner) arrives at his last duty post, an Army base in Georgia called Fort Clemons, with his wife Ladonna (Shirley Jones) and his son Billy (C. Thomas Howell). The guard at the main gate welcomes him as he enters with his family in a station wagon. Behind him is a moving van with their belongings and a World War II Sherman tank on a trailer (he tells the guard he never said he travelled light). Personnel help him remove the tarps from his prized possession as Ladonna supervises the moving of furnishings into their on-base housing. As Zack rolls the tank onto solid ground, a staff sergeant reporter from Soldier Magazine named Jerry Elliott (Mark Herrier) interviews him, as he is the only Army man who owns a tank. He has restored it over fifteen years, adding a radio and PA system so he can drive it in parades and other events. Of his two sons, his eldest son Jonathan has died and Billy, born six years later, is just 16. When asked why anybody would want to own a tank, he replies that it is very hard to shoot yourself while cleaning it.Zack visits the base commander, Major General V.E. Hubik (Sandy Ward), who is familiar with him, welcomes him wholeheartedly and takes him on a tour of the base. Zack has made an offer on a fishing boat on which he and his wife can enjoy retirement. The General says Zack could be the next senior Sergeant Major of the Army and work out of the Pentagon, but Zack says he has only one son left who will go on his own soon, and he doesn't want to miss any quality time with him. Back at the house Elliott the reporter asks Billy what his father is like, and Billy says he is a cross between George Patton and Danny Thomas.Ladonna recommends that Zack goes to the local NCO club and he finds its more like a disco, geared to a younger crowd and much too noisy for his tastes. He does run into an old friend, Ed Tippett (Dorian Harewood) who works at the base Provost Marshall's office. When Ed says to come meet the wife, Zack says he knows Linda and Ed corrects him: Gwen is the new wife. At home Zack is slightly disheartened and talks to Ladonna about the club and his friend's divorce, saying all he wants to do is finish his duty and get on the boat, then the couple share a cuddle.At his first assembly with his command personnel the next morning, Zack stresses taking care of their own without problems reaching their superiors, and keeping to Army regulations in all matters. He also says he wants to see a proper bar on the base so Army personnel of a certain age don't have to dance, as he calls it, the funky monkey. Early the next morning Zack hits the battalion field to do his morning jog and shouts for all to hear that he finds himself alone; in moments the entire battalion has filed out of their barracks and they form ranks on the field to engage in early morning physical training with their sergeant major. The General is awakened by the sound of the troops passing. He watches Zack out his bedroom window and smiles.Sometime later, when Ladonna gets home, Zack happily announces that the sellers accepted their offer on the boat. He forgot she is entertaining the NCO wives in the house that night, so they can't eat dinner at home or celebrate yet. She suggests Zack go into town for dinner. He stops at the local bar, the Outpost Café, and talks with a woman named Sarah (Jenilee Harrison), who has aspirations to go to California and become a beautician. Zack becomes loose with the beer, says he has been in the Army for 30 years and jokes that he should go into the Navy now that he is a boat owner. He starts singing a loud shanty which interrupts a pool game being played by Deputy Euclid Baker (James Cromwell) and some of his friends. Euclid quickly makes it obvious to Zack that the Army isn't particularly welcome. He then tells Sarah she has wasted too much time on Zack and should be turning tricks with paying customers, then he slaps her. Zack says that the display was not necessary, but Euclid takes another swing at Sarah. Zack punches and roughs up Euclid, then gets hold of the deputy's service pistol; the bar patrons step back in alarm, but he simply drops it in the fish tank on the bar and leaves. Sarah yells at him that she could have lost her job, but he says a simple thank you would have sufficed. He immediately goes to Ed's house to tell him what happened, knowing he has made a mistake which will bring the local constabulary looking for him. Ed says the sheriff is a particularly mean variety of Georgian cracker, and it might take considerable money to get out of the situation.The next morning Euclid greets the sheriff, Cyrus Buelton (G. D. Spradlin) and brings his morning cup of coffee. Buelton upbraids Euclid for getting beaten up by somebody and not putting that person in jail. A mark on the deputy is a mark on him, and something he won't tolerate.Zack is spotted eating at the enlisted mess hall instead of the NCO mess, ruffling the feathers of Mess Master Sergeant Johnson (John Hancock), to whom it appears to be an unannounced inspection and a breach of etiquette. He storms over to Zack in a huff, but Zack explains he chose to come in because the food smelled good. He praises the clean facility, the quality of the food and that nobody slopped food onto the plates, all of which Johnson says is no less than he expects of his staff. When Zack gives high praise to the mess sergeant's own apple cobbler, the man softens and Zack earns his respect.Buelton and Euclid visit Sarah in her trailer. The sheriff awakens her and asks if she believes in Wonder Woman or the Lone Ranger. When she seems confused, he talks to her about thinking that Zack and Army men like him are her heroes. He demands that she roll over and drop her pants so he can enforce the lesson with his belt that there is no Lone Ranger. She complies. When he sees Euclid looking down at her and smirking, he whacks him upside the head before proceeding with Sarah's whipping, which she silently and tearlessly endures. The sheriff then visits the Provost Marshall's office. Ed has expected his arrival and excuses the white clerk at the counter to take on the visitor himself. Buelton says he wants Zack in his own jail and demands he be handed over. Ed casually says he will have him delivered at once, but doesn't move. Buelton challenges Ed and calls him Sambo. Ed says he will also order that by five o'clock the town be off limits to all military personnel to prevent more problems, knowing it would affect the town's livelihood. Ed then warns the sheriff, calling him Jim (as in Crow), not to exceed the speed limit leaving the base or risk spending time in his jail. Insulted, Buelton returns to his office and demands Euclid get every piece of information available on Zack.At a visit to the post hospital Zack sees a crying five-year-old boy being held down by his mother while a doctor stitches cuts to his bloodied face. The mother says his daddy isn't mad at him anymore, and Zack realizes what has happened. He calls the kid's Army father, Corporal Harris (Larry Jordan), into his office and asks if he hit his son. The man becomes defensive and says it is none of his business, but Zack makes it his business, offering to spar with him at the base gym if he feels the need to vent anger, and demands he get counseling. Harris continues to be stubborn, so Zack puts him against the wall and warns that he will visit the hospital daily to make sure the man doesn't lay another hand on the boy, threatening to risk his rank, retirement and the stockade if necessary to stop him, and the chastened man is dismissed.Zack and Billy talk about the boat at home, and Billy mentions naming it the Johnny Boy, saying it would be fitting since Johnny was his favorite son. Zack sets him straight, saying he and his mother had a different and unique relationship with Johnny, who always tried to prove himself (which might have been what had gotten him killed). Billy should never feel that Ladonna or he loved either of them more or less than the other. At school Billy is summoned to his locker. Euclid and Sherriff Buelton ask him to open his locker, but he finds a different lock on it and his combination doesn't work. On orders, the maintenance man breaks off the lock, and a bag of marijuana has been planted inside. Zack contritely visits the jail to see Buelton, and he and Euclid take great joy in humiliating him as he admits his fault and asks what he needs to do to get Billy back. Buelton says that the judge, who happens to be his brother-in-law, will surely send Billy to the county farm for two or three years of hard labor. The sheriff takes Zack on a tour of one of the work farms and has a supervisor pull a black worker off a truck, where he was on break from the work detail, to exercise negative feedback, which consists of beating the man for malingering. Buelton demands $10,000, which he feels Zack can afford after getting word of the article in the magazine. He also warns not to bring in any lawyers. Zack says he will play it his way as long as Billy is safe. He visits his son in jail and tells Billy that Buelton is getting revenge, he will be set free soon and to stay strong. Billy calls his dad sir, and Zack stresses to Billy that he should be as polite to his captors.Back at home Ladonna slaps Zack, furious at him for \"\"whoring\"\" and putting their son in danger. She refuses to listen and says she wants to get a lawyer and bypass any of his ideas. The next day",while Zack is conducting a firearms inspection,Ladonna pulls up in the car and confesses that she had no idea what kind of man Buelton was. At the sheriff's office,Zack quietly hands Buelton the money in a bag

The Quest,1996,95,Action,5.6,Jean-Claude Van Damme,Frank Dux,Abdel Qissi,Chang Ching Peng Chaplin,Roger Moore,Jack McGee,"Comments by Actor / Writer Roy C. PetersonThis a very good movie with Jean Claude Van Damme as the hero triumphing against all odds. Van Damme also directed and did a very fine job. It's like a synthesis of Indiana Jones with Bloodsport. The story is set in the 1920s and the tournament is not the Kumite, but an equivalent called the Ghang-gheng. The script is actually based upon an amended version of the Bloodsport story which never got produced. The pageantry here is greater. Really exotic settings with a more spectacular tournament venue. More diverse ethnicity via costume. I don't know enough about any of this to comment upon authenticity. For some reason I enjoyed this movie much more the second time I saw it.","violence, intrigue",train,imdb

Miss Grimm says matter-of-factly that there is Nothing. The father announces that he will drive Nicolas himself, claiming that his son arriving in his fathers car will not make him an outcast.On the drive to the class trip, the father offers to stop for gas so that Nicolas will at last have enough redemption points to get the gift he has been eager to have: a flap book of human anatomy. The father asks Nicolas if he feels he deserves it.Nicolas is anxious he might wet the bed.

Nicolas stares at the mangled cars, while his father concentrates on driving. Nicolas recalls the family watching on television the gruesome news coverage of the recent bus accident.They arrive at the outdoor education centre, where a class is already in progress. They can see Hodkann, the class tearaway (Lokman Nalcakan), acting up. The father prompts Nicolas for a better kiss good-bye, and parts awkwardly.Miss Grimm has said they will need snow to ski, but that they will have fun in any case. Nicolas recalls a visit to a fun fair six months before. He had wanted to go on a roller coaster, but he needed his father to accompany him.

There are recent scars across the inside of the fathers wrist.During dinner, Hodkann talks with Nicolas. It is unusual for Nicolas to be on an outing with them, because the father is so overprotective. Hodkann invites Nicolas to use the empty bunk above his. Hodkann is fascinated that Nicolass father sells artificial legs. He jokes: If I were your dad Id cut off your limbs and use you for demonstration. Nicolas seems to be able to imagine his father could do that.During the night, Nicolas wakes up and checks that his mattress is dry. He dreams that his father returns the next morning, and Hodkann opens the trunk of the car to look at the plastic legs. It turns into a nightmare of masked assassins with assault rifles. They shoot the father, and go through the centre slaughtering the students. Nicolas calmly eats in the middle of all this. The teachers escape to the bus, so only Nicolas can protect his friend.

Patrick calls Nicolas a dreamer.Patrick leads relaxation exercises for the students, asking the students not to think of anything. Were always busy doing things, thinking about things, he says. But Nicolas cant stop thinking. Patrick says: Well get to know our selves, our bodies. For Nicolas, body awareness is nightmarish. He imagines opening the flap in his anatomy booklet to see a real, pulsating internal organ, and imagines the heart beating in his chest. He turns Patricks directions about breathing slowly into nightmares of not being able to blow into a spirometer, of gasping, of his father pushing him into a swimming pool, where he flails in terror. He only relaxes when Patrick presses fingertips on his chest and repeats directly to him: Slowly.Dorm highjinks reveal an appendix scar on a boys buttock, which is viewed with scepticism because normally the scar would not be on the back. This is precisely the kind of scar Nicolass father had described being found on a boy whose kidney was stolen.Nicolas wakes again during the night and checks his mattress. He dreams of riding the roller-coaster with Hodkann, and seeing the man at the midway lead his little brother Tom away towards a waiting ambulance. But the nightmare turns to the thrill of enjoying the exciting ride, and he wakes up to find he has had a wet dream.Nicolas goes down to the kitchen to wipe off his pyjamas. On his way back, he sees that it is snowing. He goes outside, and gets locked out. He gets into Patricks car and wraps up in a blanket.

Miss Grimm is speaking to the mother on the phone, only to learn that the father hasnt been heard from, which she calls strange. She assumes Nicolas had been sleepwalking, but the mother doesnt think it is serious. Nicolas does not want to talk to his mother. He asks Miss Grimm if a sleepwalker can be deemed guilty if they do something bad. Nicolas is thinking about his nocturnal emission, but Miss Grimm assumes Nicolas is worried that his father has had an accident. She jokingly says, Maybe you dont want him back. Nicolas seems to have a tranquil look.Nicolas can hear a language lesson going on in the next room, while he lies in bed. He recalls taking a book from his parents bedroom and reading the story The Monkeys Paw. He imagines his parents acting out the story, finally ending with his father stomping on his severed hand, shouting the final wish: Make him die forever!Hodkann is fascinated by the idea of sleepwalking, and wants to know all about it. Nicolas strings a tale of seeing organ traffickers outside and following them.The next day, the students go skiing. Nicolas sits in the ski lodge with some comic books, and sees the police arrive to inquire about a local boy, René, missing for two days. Nicolas asks for a copy of the poster, saying: I disappeared two days ago, too.Hodkann asks Nicolas about the police. That night, Nicolas elaborates his story of kidnappers and organ traffickers. He says he is helping his father settle the score for the theft of his little brothers kidney. Hodkann is sure the father is in danger, but Nicolas swears him to secrecy.On the bus to the next days skiing, Nicolas and Hodkann are both very sombre, while all the other students sing joyfully. When they arrive at the ski hill, however, there are police on the scene. Patrick learns that the body of René had been found about 180km awayin another region. The police are heard mentioning that a grey Renault was seen. The teachers suggest that the students pray. Nicolas prays, and recalls praying alongside his mother.The teachers are upset. Miss Grimm cannot teach her math lesson. They do their best to quell morbid talk and maintain calm. They distract the students with a dance that evening. While he dances, Nicolas visualizes a spinning drive shaft on his fathers car propelling it relentlessly along the road. The police arrive to ask the teachers if they can recall anything useful. Nicolas sees Hodkann sneak outside.That night, Hodkann explains to Nicolas that he had overheard the police ask the teachers about a grey Renault. He had gone out to meet the police, because Miss Grimm had failed to tell them that Nicolass father had a grey Renault. He is convinced that he needed to tell them so they could protect Nicolass father from the organ traffickers. Nicolas knows his father may be in deep trouble because of his story, or that he himself will be in deep trouble because his story has misled the police, and he faints.The next morning, the doctor says that Nicolas is reacting to the news of the murder, and that it is a cry for help. He is seeking attention from his mother because he did not get enough love or attention from her. He advises that Nicolas and Miss Grimm should both rest, so they stay behind while the others go off skiing.Miss Grimm takes a phone call concerning Nicolas. Seen indistinctly through the pebble glass of the office, Miss Grimm is very upset by the call. The Rossini Agnus Dei plays. When Patrick returns with the other students, he and Miss Grimm have a serious conversation. When he comes out of the office, he tells Nicolas that there is a problem at home, and that he will take Nicolas back the next day.

He realizes that it is not himself who is in trouble, but his father. He watches his father with what appears to be pity. The piano chords of the Agnus Dei play. As he waits for his drink, he watches a beautiful mother cooing and playing with her baby lying on a change table. Nicolas,s tense face relaxes a little, and he and the mother exchange little smiles. Nicolas fantacizes about walking up behind the mother and reaching out to touch her hair. The string bracelet falls to the floor.Patrick tells Nicolas he will take him to his door, but say good-bye in the car. The piano chords of the Agnus Dei play as they walk down the hallway of the apartment building. Nicolas reaches up to ring the doorbell.Hodkann is staring at the television in the teachers office. He sees the footage of Nicolass father in police custody, his head being covered by a trench coat. Hodkann looks dismayed, confused, perhaps even in shock. The piano chords of the Agnus Dei begin again.The credits roll over an aerial shot of snow-covered forest, and the whole Rossini Agnus Dei continues Lamb of God, have mercy on us reaching the closing phrase Dona nobis pacemGrant us your peace.","fantasy, murder, sadist, violence, haunting, flashback, romantic, storytelling",train,imdb

The film begins with the suicide of Peter, and ends with Karen in the hospital. This is a synopsis of the director's cut, so some events may not be featured in the original PG-13 version.Kayako Saeki (Takako Fuji), a young Japanese woman, is unhappily married to Takeo Saeki (Takashi Matsuyama). She becomes obsessed with Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman), an American college professor working in Tokyo. She writes about her feelings for him in a diary. She follows him and sends him love letters. One night, Kayako returns home and enters her bedroom upstairs. She finds her husband reading her diary. In a rage, Takeo attacks Kayako, shoving her to the floor, banging the walls while yelling and screaming. Kayako breaks her ankle and crawls down the stairs, but before she can escape, Takeo catches her and snaps her neck.Takeo looks up to see their eight-year-old son, Toshio Saeki (Yuya Ozeki), at the top of the stairs; a witness to the murder. Takeo drags Toshio to the bathroom and drowns him in the bathtub. Takeo also slits Toshio's cat's throat and tosses the carcass on the floor of the bathroom. He wraps Kayako's body in plastic trash bags and places it far in the corner of the attic. He puts Toshio's body in his bedroom closet and tapes it shut with Duct tape, and then hangs himself.In order to find out why Kayako is sending him the letters, Peter Kirk comes to the Saeki residence the next day with one of Kayako's love letters in hand. He sees Toshio's hands hanging out of the bathroom window, bruised and scratched. Peter goes inside and decides to stay with the boy until the parents return. Peter looks through the rest of the house, entering Takeo and Kayako's bedroom in the back where he finds several family photos in a pile on the floor. Kayako's face has been torn out of every one of them. He finds Kayako's diary and thumbs through it, learning more about Kayako's obsession with him.The closet door catches his eye and, upon inspecting it, he finds the cut-outs of Kayako's face nailed all over the door and smeared with blood. Kayako's lifeless corpse falls out from the attic and lands on the closet shelf. Peter runs into the hall and hears thumping noises coming from Toshio's room and finds Takeo hanging from a noose of Kayako's hair. The next morning, in front of his wife, Maria (Rosa Blasi), Peter commits suicide by jumping off the balcony just outside his apartment bedroom.Matthew Williams (William Mapother), his wife, Jennifer (Clea DuVall), and ailing mother, Emma (Grace Zabriskie) move to Tokyo as a result of Matthew's promotion. His sister, Susan (KaDee Strickland), also lives in Tokyo and helps them find a home. Matthew and Jennifer decide on a suburban house despite Emma's strange reactions to the place. Emma's health and condition deteriorate rapidly following the move. Jennifer becomes disenchanted with life in Japan as she cannot sleep during (what she assumes to be) Emma's restless stirrings, unable to speak the language, and has gotten lost once on a walk. Matthew assures her things will improve and that if they don't, the family will return to the United States.Jennifer falls asleep on a couch in the living room, after having made and partially eaten a bowl of ramen, which she left on the table. The sound of the bowl hitting the floor wakes her. She scolds Emma for making the mess, but then sees a trail of wet child's footprints leading out to the hall.

The door closes behind her.Matthew returns from work and finds the house in complete disarray with trash strewn everywhere. He calls out to his wife, who doesn't answer.

He backs up against the closet as Toshio appears suddenly over his head.Later, Susan is preparing to leave the office. After attempting to call, Susan increasingly becomes concerned from not being able to reach Matthew. She then attempts to visit the house, but she is stopped by the sound of moaning coming from the hallway. She quickly exits to the stairs but is frightened when the lights start to flicker and shatter. Susan looks over the railing to see Kayako's ghost crawling up the stairs. Susan flees to the security office, seeking help. There, the security guard promises to go check it out. Susan watches the monitor as the security guard investigates.

She enters an elevator, and it ascends several floors. Susan does not notice, however, that Toshio is standing outside each set of elevator doors she passes. Susan makes it safely inside when her phone rings. It is Matthew claiming to have forgotten her apartment number and asking to be buzzed inside. She tells him where to find her and activates the buzzer with the phone. Before she can hang up, the doorbell rings immediately. Thinking Matthew couldn't possibly have had time to arrive, she checks the peephole of the door. Shocked to find it is Matthew, Susan believes he is pranking her. She angrily throws open the door, but no one is there. The death rattle sound emerges loudly through the phone in Susan's hand. She drops and breaks the phone, yet the death rattle can still be heard. Cowering in bed, Susan reaches beneath the covers and pulls out the rabbit's foot phone charm from her phone and drops it in fear. A lump billows from underneath the covers and moves toward Susan. She lifts the sheets and finds herself staring into the face of Kayako's ghost. It yanks her under the covers, and the sheets fall flat upon the now empty bed.Yoko (Yoko Maki) is a girl whose work is to take care of Emma and clean the house.

The three agency workers look at each other with shifty eyes before the older woman gently takes Veronica's arm, leading her toward the car, and her voice suddenly becomes dangerous as she reminds Veronica that the agency knows where her parents live-- and that she has a very young son.Vadim suddenly grabs Veronica and pulls her into the car, covering her mouth with his hand. The brunette girl drops her suitcase and flees with Manuelo in pursuit. The brunette girl runs straight across the roadway leading out of the airport... into its traffic. A passenger car tries to slow down, but cannot do so in time. The brunette girl is struck down by the car, and she lies dead on the ground. Veronica screams, but Vadim's hand covering her mouth keeps anyone from hearing. Manuelo and the older woman jump into their car and drive off with Veronica, while the gathering crowd is focused on the dead young woman lying in the road.We see Jorge approaching an American tourist, offering to act as a guide. When the tourist seems disinterested, Jorge offers him a brochure for a museum, which, when opened, is shown to contain photographs of beautiful, naked young Mexican women. Jorge gives a smooth pitch about how these girls can please American tourists and that American money goes a long way in Mexico.The tourist follows Jorge toward this encounter, only to find that it's a setup. Jorge's two friends quickly flank the tourist, pistols drawn and pressed against his neck. They divest him of his wallet, suitcase and all his other valuables, before slyly suggesting he now hates all Mexicans, and they in turn, hate gringos. They make it look like they're going to kill him, but the guns shoot only water. Jorge and his two friends run off quickly, laughing uproariously as the tourist stands shaken in the empty street. The three of them meet a large circle of friends at a Mexican cantina, where they party and celebrate into the evening.The next morning, Adriana is drawing a card for Jorge as thanks for the bicycle. She sneaks to her mother's room, while her mother is still sleeping, and quietly grabs the keys off a small bookcase. Adriana goes out riding her bicycle across the neighborhood, against her mother's orders. Watching the neighborhood pan by her, she doesn't notice a black car beginning to follow her. Finally looking over her shoulder, she sees the car and smiles as she waves to them to let them know she'll slow down so they can drive ahead, but the car doesn't oblige. Adriana finally begins to understand that something's very amiss, and she quickly turns into a narrow alley, through which the car cannot follow. She looks relieved as the car pauses for a few seconds, and then drives away.But the driver of the car knows the ramshackle shanty neighborhood better than Adriana does. As she emerges from the other end of the alley, the car is there, cutting her off. Adriana's bike tips over and she falls off, onto the ground. Two men jump out of the car, grab Adriana up and carry her, kicking and screaming, inside, before driving off with her, leaving her bike in the street.Jorge and one of his accomplices are hanging out on the corner in front of the cantina as their other friend is making out with a girl in their car. A young boy rides by on a bicycle, and Jorge's friend laughs, saying the boy is riding a girl's bike.Jorge looks and realizes to his shock, that the boy is riding Adriana's bike. Springing to his feet, he chases after the boy as his friends run to catch up. Jorge catches the boy, pulling him off the bike and down to the ground. The three start roughing him up as Jorge accuses him of stealing the bike. The boy protests he found it in the street and offers to lead them there if they don't hurt him.The boy brings them to where he found the bike. Jorge looks crushed as he sees the card Adriana drew for him, still lying on the ground. He runs to a residential hut and pounds on the door, asking the tenant if she saw what happened to the girl on the bike. But Jorge's two friends quickly point out that in this shanty neighborhood, nobody seees anything-- often by choice. Their only hope is to see a local government official they know, named Don Victor.Victor tells them that he has a hunch who's taken Adriana. Mexico City is a prime stalking ground for Russian sex traffickers looking for young virgins. Adriana's young age means she's surely a virgin, which to a sex trafficker, is worth her weight in gold. Jorge asks for Victor's help, but Victor warns him that these traffickers are dangerous men with a large network throughout Mexico City. He laughs noisily at Jorge's insistence that he and his friends aren't afraid of anyone, letting them know that the Russians are not to be messed with. Looking over his shoulder, Jorge finds that Victor is right-- his two best friends have quickly been intimidated into not wanting to stick their necks out in such a manner. Jorge rages in anger until Victor grabs him and sits him down, describing what he knows of the traffickers' M.O. They each have several contacts in Mexico City, using them to sell and trade the girls from one hand to another, until they're smuggled into America near a large airport, such as Newark in New Jersey. Finally they're sold for a lot of money to degenerate men looking to deflower such young virgin girls.Vadim and Manuelo herd Veronica into one of many stash houses where captive girls are kept; one waypoint of many along the route into brutal slavery. A dangerous looking, large dog makes thoughts of flight vanish into thin air. Veronica fearfully begs Vadim not to hurt her. Vadim merely tells her to sit and relax. As 'encouragement,' he holds a photo of Veronica's little son and tears it in half, letting the pieces drop to the floor. Suddenly he punches the frightened young woman right in her face and throws her to the floor, grabbing her by her throat. Forcing Veronica onto her stomach, he shoves her skirt up to her hips and yanks her panties down to her knees, before dropping his pants and raping her. The other captive girls, including Adriana, huddle in the far corner, terrified.As Vadim rapes Veronica, her mind spins back to the travel agency she visited in Poland, which helped her arrange her flight. The agent told Veronica that a layover in Mexico City would save her a lot of money, and it was close to Los Angeles, rich with job openings so she could make enough money to bring her son into America. When she asked why they needed the names and addresses of her parents, the agent smiled and said, 'standard bureaucratic nonsense.' Gears click and Veronica understands this was the first step in the terrible trap laid for her.Jorge's friends drop him near a back alley where Don Victor knows young women are paraded around in a circle while prospective johns look them over like a herd of cattle. He walks through the alley, discreetly trying to see each woman's face, and finds Adriana isn't there.At the stash house, Manuelo is making Adriana take a pill. He then goes to the mattress where Veronica still lays, dazed after her rape. Her eyes drift open as he reaches out to touch her. Manuelo tells her that he has a vitamin for her that will help ease the pain she's in. Veronica takes the pill and puts it in her mouth, but declines a sip of water. Manuelo gets up and walks out. Soon as she hears the door close, Veronica spits the pill back out.Adriana picks up the pieces of the torn photograph and puts them near Veronica's hand. Veronica pushes the pieces underneath her body as Adriana sits near her. Both girls speak just enough English to communicate. Veronica sees that Adriana wears a necklace with an image of Mary, and asks if Adriana prays to her. Adriana says she does, and that Mary will guide Jorge to find her. Tears come to Adriana's eyes as she leans over and hugs Veronica as she would a sister.Jorge walks through crowded streets as he asks any random passerby whose attention he can get, about Adriana, giving a description that he doesn't realize is painfully vague and can apply to any of millions of young teenage girls in Mexico City. Worse, he doesn't know just how close he is to the stash house. Manuelo opens a door and herds the captive girls out, including Adriana. Jorge happens to turn to one side and look into a mirror, which shows a reflection over his shoulder. He sees Adriana, and Vadim and Manuelo. Jorge hides behind a cart, getting a good look at Vadim's face as he herds the girls into a truck, and his female accomplice drives up with a very young boy. Jorge races back to the cantina where he finds his friend Alejandro high on pot while sitting in the car. He throws Alejandro out onto the street and jumps in the car, trying to follow the truck.In the truck, Veronica sees one of the other captives is feeling very sick. She goes to Adriana and tells her not to swallow any more pills. She knows that they're no vitamins, but a drug to keep the captives under control.The truck stops and the girls are delighted to see two Mexican border agents-- but quickly find the officers receive sex with captive girls in return for looking the other way on the trafficking. One of the agents chooses Veronica, and Manuelo orders the other girls out of the truck onto the road to wait. Veronica assures Adriana that they can't hurt her any more than they already have. As the agent climbs into the truck and leers at Veronica, Jorge hides behind a rock slope, watching the truck. The traffickers are using a produce delivery truck to look inconspicuous.Manuelo pays the other guard for fake ID's and passports for the other girls. He makes Adriana put on a pretty dress and shoes, and pose provocatively for a photograph as Jorge watches in outrage. Unable to watch any further, he hunkers down behind the rock slope and cries.In the shanty outskirts of Juárez, a town near the border, Jorge's car runs out of fuel. He gets out and runs frantically down the road, seeing that he's lost sight of the truck.Veronica, Adriana and several other captive children are in a stash house in Juárez. Adriana tries to offer a portion of what food they've been given, to Veronica, concerned that the older girl hasn't eaten. Veronica only stares at the torn photo of her child, trying to fit the pieces together as if she could undo the tear. Manuelo walks into the cell, picks up a stuffed doll, and mocks Veronica not eating. Furiously angry, with no concern for her personal well-being, Veronica jumps to her feet, boldly and brazely telling Manuelo that one day, he'll suffer for all he's done, not only to her, but the other children. Manuelo stares back for a few seconds before laughing Veronica off and calling her a communist.Jorge finds a small shop and thirstily gulps down water from a bottle. He asks the shop owner if he can use her phone. Jorge calls his mother, but can't answer when she asks in a wary tone if it's him. He hangs up and glances out the window, spotting the produce truck again.Late in the evening, Jorge creeps over to the truck and finds his way to the stash house. It's now abandoned, the holding cage empty. As Jorge looks at the few clothes left on the mattresses and on the floor, he hears the sound of another car. Hearing someone getting out of the car, he hides behind the refrigerator in the kitchen.Ray Sheridan (Kevin Kline), an insurance fraud investigator, walks into the stash house, his flashlight beam shining near Jorge's location but not onto him. As Ray passes by the kitchen, heading toward the caged enclosure, Jorge creeps out of the stash house behind him, and hides in the trunk of Ray's car. Meanwhile, Ray shines his flashlight along old, semi-faded sketches covering the walls of the caged enclosure, many showing scenes of kids with families, and being pulled away from them; sketches made by frightened, despairing children.Manuelo brings the captives to the Rio Grande river on foot. When they see he expects them to wade across it, they recoil uncertainly, until Veronica takes point in climbing down and wading across. Adriana and the other children follow, with Manuelo bringing up the rear. Soon as they're across, a border patrol vehicle comes driving up; border officers coming out to arrest everyone. Manuelo grabs Adriana and warns all the kids not to say a word, or he'll make sure all their family members are killed.As yet unaware of the stowaway he carries, Ray gets a room in a motel and calls his wife, Patty (Linda Emond). He tells her he's in Juárez, although he doesn't tell her why. He says he'll be home tomorrow. Their pet cat is ill and Patty needs to take her to the vet. After hanging up, Ray pulls out a wrinkled old photo of a girl looking to be around five or six years old, looking at it. The next morning, as Ray is driving across the border, a radio news program talks about (then-President) George W. Bush having spent $1.9 billion on tightening border security against unlawful immigration.Manuelo and his captives are in an immigrant detention center. As Manuelo is being documented, Veronica rushes to the gate, frightfully begging a guard to listen to her. But he only laughs her off when she tries to tell him that she's a kidnap victim.A school bus drops off a class of high-school students learning the Spanish language. One of the girls goes over to Adriana and introduces herself, saying why she's here, and gives Adriana an American fashion magazine.Driving through a town on the American side of the border, Ray stops at a gas station convenience store for a beverage. As he's returning to his car, he hears a noise from the trunk. He goes to investigate and discovers Jorge. Jorge tries to slam the trunk against Ray and make a run for it, but Ray proves too much for Jorge to handle, deftly grappling him and forcing him into the back passenger seat, telling Jorge that he's a cop and they're taking a ride to the nearest police station.With nothing else to lose, Jorge tells Ray the truth about why he hid in Ray's car to sneak into America. Ray is, as expected, skeptical, until Jorge tells how he saw Ray go into the stash house in Juárez; the same house Jorge had tracked his sister to. Ray still maintains some skepticism, but tries to assure Jorge that the American police will help him if he's being truthful. Jorge, however, is too distrustful of any police, whether in Mexico or America, and points out that even if they think he's telling the truth, they'll just deport him back to Mexico and then probably drag their feet on finding Adriana until she's through the 'tunnel' and sold off, at which point she'll become untraceable. But after Jorge finishes his plea, Ray only says he's going to the police.Manuelo and party have been deported back across the border into Mexico, and he's marching them back along a different route. As Manuelo watches a patrolling vehicle, the children all pray before a Catholic shrine. As they all begin moving again, Veronica looks back and sees Manuelo praying at the shrine.At the police station, Ray appears to be struggling with whether to believe Jorge's story. He tells Jorge not to move, and shows his badge to the front desk officer, asking to speak to the officer's CO about 'that boy who says his sister's been kidnapped.' The officer promptly asks, 'Which boy?' and Ray sees he should have known better than to think Jorge would listen to 'Don't move.'Fortunately, it takes Ray little time to find and catch up to Jorge. This time Ray offers to help Jorge himself, saying he knows someone from the Academy who he can turn to. Having already been hauled to the police station once, Jorge has little reason to believe Ray now, until Ray points out that Jorge's chances of success in finding his sister are nil, without his help.Manuelo herds the captives back across the river and are met by Alex Green (Zack Ward), a contact in the 'tunnel' with a van to continue bringing them all toward New Jersey.Alex stops at a rest stop where trafficked girls are traded and johns can pay for sex. When Manuelo tries to take Adriana out of the car, Veronica comes to her defense, fiercely insisting she be taken instead. Seeing a look in Manuelo's eyes, she challenges him as being afraid of her. But Manuelo simply punches her square in her nose, knocking her unconscious, and yanks Adriana out of the car. He sells a middle-aged john a blow job from her for $80, saying he can't take regular intercourse because she's still a virgin. The john herds Adriana through tall reed grass, where several other girls plead tearfully to no avail, as other johns force the girls to pleasure them. Adriana is sold several times, forced to give blow jobs to a number of men who each pay Manuelo $80 for her time.Ray is on the phone with Patty at a rest stop, learning that the vet put their cat to sleep. Patty takes her grief out on Ray, who didn't bring his cell phone with him to Juárez, making him unreachable.Ray and Jorge are sitting down to eat at the rest stop's diner. Ray sees a man sitting at a booth with a young Thai boy. As a waitress takes their order, the man leaves with the boy, Ray watching them. Noticing, Jorge turns to look, and suddenly jumps to his feet, saying he knows the kid.Jorge races out, quickly losing sight of the man and boy. Tearing through the parking lot, he causes a scene which attracts a passing officer, who demands to see identification, which Jorge isn't carrying. Fortunately, Ray catches up and shows his badge, acting as if Jorge is his son.Jorge tells Ray that he saw the Thai boy being put into the same truck that Adriana was put into. Turning, they see the pedophile again leading the boy through the parking lot and push him into a public restroom. Ray orders Jorge to take the boy to the police, and then warns the pedophile about the cops, and that they can go outside to deal with them, or Ray can ask the man for information one on one.As the police move in to arrest the pedophile, Ray hurries Jorge away with bad news. The pedophile bought the boy from the traffickers, but didn't see what happened to the others. He has no idea where they are or where they were going.Manuelo and Alex are with Veronica, Adriana and the Brazilian girl at another stash house. Manuelo is posting photos he took of Adriana onto a child trafficking website. In the bathroom, Veronica grimly brushes her teeth, and turns at the sound of Adriana sobbing. As she showers, Adriana cries that after what's happened to her, her mother won't love her anymore, meaning she can't go home even if she's rescued. Veronica tries to comfort the girl and insists that her mother will always love her.Alex comes into the restroom and forces them both to swallow a pill. He holds Veronica's nose and covers her mouth, leaving her unable to breathe until she swallows. Fearful at the display, Adriana takes her pill willingly.In the middle of the night, Ray makes Jorge wait just outside an internet cafe. Going online, Ray finds his way to the trafficking website. giving the correct user names and passwords to navigate through the correct locations of a seemingly legitimate real estate website to reach photos and auction information on trafficked children. As he looks through the photographs, Jorge comes up behind him. He points at a photograph, saying that's his sister. Adriana's name is given as Maria, and her age is falsely listed as 15. Jorge fights back bile as he sees the photos that he watched Manuelo take of Adriana, along with an online auction ID number, and that bidding will start at $500 soon.Later that morning, Ray has passed the information on to his contact, who'll forward it to the internet crimes unit. As Ray mentions he gave his contact the website location and passwords, Jorge realizes Ray got all this from the pedophile they'd stopped at the diner. Ray says the pedophile paid $25,000 as the highest bidder, to have the boy smuggled in from Thailand and delivered to him. They need to get to New Jersey in time for when Adriana is auctioned.Waking up, Adriana and Veronica overhear Manuelo arguing with someone he calls 'Laura' on his cell phone. After hanging up, Manuelo tells Alex that Adriana's auction has been set up for tomorrow and they have to be in New Jersey by then. Alex had freaked out on drugs during the night and accidentally killed the Brazilian girl, meaning Veronica and Adriana are the only remaining captives in Manuelo's custody.Alex stops the van off the road and gets out to relieve himself. Manuelo sees both Veronica and Adriana are asleep, so he steps out as well. But Veronica was wide awake and alert, and sees her chance. Waking Adriana, she creeps out around the back of the van, and the two girls make their break.Veronica and Adriana make it across the road into a town that is in the midst of a parade and celebration. Veronica and Adriana hug joyfully. Veronica spots a police officer watching the parade and tells Adriana to go to him, while Veronica goes to a pay phone across the street to call and warn her family.But as Veronica struggles through the waiting to get through the proper operators and call her family in Poland, Adriana stops short of approaching the police officer and starts to run back to Veronica's side. The worst is yet to come, as Veronica reaches her mother and, instead of starting to explain what's happened to her, only tries to tell her mother to take Gregor (Veronica's son) and leave, as they're in danger. Veronica's mother asks, puzzled, whether Gregor hasn't already arrived in America.Veronica becomes hysterical, not paying attention to Adriana, who sees Alex and Manuelo's van turning the corner in search of them. Veronica's mother says that people came from the agency, showed all the correct papers Veronica signed, and said they were there to arrange Gregor's travel to America. The traffickers have Veronica's son in custody. Unable to believe what she's hearing, Veronica fails to react as the van roars up, and Manuelo and Alex grab her and Adriana, dragging them back inside the van. Manuelo tells a dazed Veronica that both she and her son will pay for this.The van stops at another rest stop, overlooking a high bluff. Manuelo orders Veronica out of the van. It's painfully obvious he's going to beat her within an inch of her life as punishment for her attempted escape.But Veronica looks disturbingly calm and serene as she looks out over the bluff. Lifting the hood of her sweatshirt, she turns to Manuelo and smiles at him, before telling him that she'll make sure that he pays for everything he's done. Adriana, Alex and Manuelo alike, look on in horror as Veronica turns and sprints straight toward the edge of the bluff, leaping to her death before Manuelo can catch her.Both parties make it to New Jersey. While Jorge and Ray head into the city proper, Alex drops off Manuelo and Adriana in the suburbs, and another stash house where Adriana will be held until she's auctioned. Waiting in the stash house for them is Laura (Kate Del Castillo), a woman overseer in the trafficking operation. Laura appears to be a Mexican-American woman in her mid twenties. She treats Adriana better than Manuelo did, and better than she treats Manuelo. Laura is furious to hear that both Veronica and the Brazilian girl didn't make it, telling Manuelo that Vadim has lost $50,000 over the botched delivery.Ray and Jorge check into a Holiday Inn. Checking the auction website, they find that Adriana's online auction will begin at 2 PM. Ray leaves Jorge at the hotel and meets with his contact, Detective Hank Jefferson (Tim Reid) to speak with a local detective named Henderson. There, Ray finds that Henderson knows where the New Jersey operation is based, but he's looking at a bigger picture: The trafficking operation is all over the globe. The auction website is on a server in the Maldives, and their bank is in South Africa. Traffickers and contacts are all over the country, and around the world. The internet crimes unit is trying to bide their time, gathering as much intel as possible, looking for a way to stamp out the operation as close to the root as they can. Adriana's handlers are a small part in one area, and moving on them will cause the operation to move around and vanish back under the radar. Ray is disgusted at the seeming indifference toward the fate of one innocent Mexican girl.Jorge awakens to overhear Ray talking to Patty on the phone. Ray has asked to withdraw a large amount of money from their savings, and he'll tell her all about it when he gets home. Patty asks Ray if he's found his daughter, and he says he might have. She tells him that, if he locates her, to bring her home.Ray finally opens up to Jorge, showing him a picture of Carly, Ray's daughter from an extramarital affair shortly after he married Patty. Ray was down in Juárez to investigate a possible lead on Carly's whereabouts. Officers arrived to tell Ray that Alma, the Mexican woman with whom Ray had the affair, died a few days ago of a drug overdose, and they found an unsent letter to Ray, written ten years earlier, among her possessions. Ray always knew Alma had a daughter, but until receiving the letter, didn't know for sure the child was his. Talking with a police detective who worked near a house where Alma lived, Ray found out that Alma had gone to Juárez just about the time she wrote the letter to Ray, and came back two years later without Carly. As a lifelong drug addict, Alma had likely sold her daughter for drug money. If Alma had sent the letter right away, Ray would have come to pick up Carly himself and bring her home, where he and Patty would care for her. Ray shows Carly's photo to Jorge, who says that Carly has beautiful green eyes (Ray mentions Alma had the same eyes).Adriana has been dressed as a school girl. In her room, she prays that Veronica is happy in heaven. She asks Veronica to talk to the Virgin Mary for her. Adriana's one hope is that if she's sold, that it be to a kind man.Jorge and Ray go to the hotel internet center and log into the trafficking website in time for Adriana's auction. The auction is harrowing for Jorge, as bidders named Little Buddha and South African Master, bid against them for Adriana. Jorge seems almost ready to break down as he and Ray are outbid again. Ray tells Jorge to wait until two seconds before closure of bidding before raising to thirty-two thousand. The website signals the end of the auction and Jorge holds his breath, until the website signals he and Ray have won. A chat window opens up on the website asking for their address. Immediately Ray gets a call from Laura, who tells him that he'll get an address on his computer where he's to bring the money, and she'll bring the girl, that simple.But it's not as simple as Laura suggested. Ray is sent to the parking lot of a shopping center, where Manuelo tells him to get into his van and he'll drive Ray to the stash house, or else the deal's off. Ray is to leave the car there and he'll be driven back with Adriana. Ray pops his trunk just before leaving with Manuelo. Jorge gets out of the trunk and begins following Manuelo in the car.Manuelo brings Ray to the stash house where he's greeted by Laura. Adriana sits in a chair nearby. Ray gives the money to Manuelo, who runs it through a counter. Laura is eager to close the transaction, but Ray makes a dangerous mistake. Laura's green eyes and approximate age remind him of Carly, and he tries to strike up small talk, asking where she's from. Her suspicions writhing, Laura confronts Ray on being a possible cop. She has an easy way to find out-- Ray has to take Adriana upstairs and have sex with her in the bedroom. If he doesn't, Laura knows he's a cop, and she'll kill him. If he does, he's now a child sex offender, meaning he has too much to lose, himself, if he tries to turn Laura in. Since Adriana is a virgin, there will be blood on the sheets after legitimate intercourse.Upstairs in the privacy of the room, Ray tells Adriana that he's here with Jorge, looking to rescue her. Adriana excuses herself, going into the bathroom, where Ray hears her cry out in pain. She comes out with her blood on her hand to smear on the sheet to fool Laura. But Manuelo opens the door to check in just in time to catch Adriana in the act. Adriana runs after him, telling him it's not too late, reminding him that Veronica is watching. She touches his hand with her bloody thumb. Manuelo is haunted at the gesture and walks down in a daze, lying to Laura that her demand to Ray has been satisfied.Laura tells Ray that Adriana is now his, and Manuelo will drive them back to his car and he can be on his way. Just as Ray and Adriana walk out, Laura sarcastically calls after them, \"\"What a nice daddy.\"\" Her tone of voice makes Ray turn around and hand her a deadly glare of suspicion. Manuelo turns around to look over his shoulder. Jorge suddenly lunges out of the bushes",bashing Manuelo across the face with a crowbar. Laura pulls a gun and points it at Ray point blank,her eyes seething with wrath. But police are swarming over and through the house,surrounding Laura from all directions. Laura holds Ray at gunpoint for a tense moment before she gets on her knees and surrenders. Hank

Beowulf,2007,115,Action,6.3,Robert Zemeckis,Neil Gaiman,Brice Martin,John Bilezikjian,Ray Winstone,Ray Winstone,"\"Movie opens up with a celebration in the Great Hall of Heorot, built by Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins), king of the Danes. The Danes are celebrating the completion of the Hall, and theyre really boozing it up and partying quite loudly. Booziest of all is Hrothgar himself quite inebriated, half-naked, slurring his words and barely able to keep his balance. He's somewhat repulsive and a bit of an embarrassment to his young wife, Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).The revelers begin to chant, pounding the ground in time with the chanting. The camera pulls away from the Hall, to the snowy hills surrounding the kingdom, where the chanting and thumping have died out and all is silent. Finally, we pull into a cave miles away, where the chanting and thumping are suddenly heard at an almost unbearably loud level. We hear something in the cave screaming in pain, as if the noise is too much for it to bear.Back to Heorot, where after-hours are still rocking full-blast. The large wooden entrance doors are blasted off their hinges, the halls torches blow out, and the hearth in the middle of the hall erupts in eerie blue flames. People start wigging, as we hear same the something from the cave screaming right outside Heorot's doorway. As the Danes gird their loins and take up arms, the creature enters.It's huge, about 15 feet tall and vaguely humanoid in appearance, but clearly not all human. Its misshapen, deformed, and appears to have, instead of ears, some highly sensitive pads that serve as hearing organs. The screaming of the Danes seems to hurt the creatures ears and, enraged, he begins to tear the revelers apart, literally.Eventually, the creature makes his way to Hrothgar, who, to his credit, didn't run away in a drunken panic, but held his ground. The King demands that the monster fight him, but the creature is unafraid. It simply takes a long almost quizzical look at Hrothgar and abruptly withdraws.Back at his cave, the monster is chastised by his mother for killing men. We don't see his mother, though we catch glimpses of her reflection in the caves pool. We cant tell exactly what she is, but we see enough to know that she isn't even remotely human.The dead are removed from Heorot and burned, and the Hall is sealed as a place of evil. Hrothgar confers with his majordomo Unferth (John Malkovich). We come to find that the creature is named Grendel (Crispin Glover), and that it has apparently plagued these Danes in the past. The King tells Unferth to put out the word that the man who slays Grendel will earn half of the kingdoms riches in return. The King pointedly states that they need a hero.We cut to a ship at sea, the mainsail bearing the likeness of a large wolf. The ship is navigating a brutal storm, and at the prow we see our hero, Beowulf (Ray Winstone), and his lieutenant and good friend, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson). They are unfazed by the extremely rough seas, and discuss with much bravado how they are on their way to take up Hrothgar's offer and slay Grendel, and how the glory of their deeds will live eternally.They land on Danish shores and are taken to Hrothgar, who greets Beowulf warmly, apparently having known his father. Beowulf asks that Heorot be reopened, and Hrothgar acquiesces, providing Beowulf and his crew with food, drink and lodging as they rest in preparation for their battle.In the revelry, Beowulf catches the eye of Queen Wealthow (and vice versa), although the two exchange nothing more than polite pleasantries. Unferth seems angered by Beowulf's presence, and calls him out. Seems that Unferth has heard a story about Beowulf being challenged to a swimming race and losing. How, Unferth asks, can Beowulf be expected to slay Grendel if he can't even outswim a human opponent in a simple race.After trading some insults with Unferth, Beowulf admits the tale is true, but explains why he lost the race. As Beowulf narrates, in flashback we see him swimming in the ocean against his opponent, only to be set upon by a giant sea monster. As his competitor swims to safety, Beowulf fights and kills the monster, and another, and another each in increasingly fantastic fashion. It is implied that this tale is somewhat exaggerated, though not altogether untrue. The flashback shows us something that Beowulf pointedly does not tell the Danes that after fighting the monsters underwater, Beowulf came across a siren/mermaid/water nymph. Shes breathtakingly beautiful, in an otherworldly sort of way, and Beowulf cant take his eyes off her.We snap back to the present (no mention of what finally happened with the mermaid), and Beowulf and Unferth are still hostile toward each other. Hrothgar breaks it up, retiring to his chambers while the Queen sings a song for the Geats (Beowulf and crew, a.k.a. folks from Sweden), though the song is clearly meant for Beowulf alone. When the Queen finally retires, and Hrothgar demands that she get in bed and produce an heir, Wealthow states that she could never lie with the King, knowing that you laid down with her. The King is duly shamed, though were not told exactly why.The Danes all pack it in, leaving Beowulf and crew in the Hall to prepare for Grendel. Beowulf notes that he will fight Grendel hand-to-hand, since no weapon seems to harm the monster anyway. Further with the machismo, Beowulf strips naked, planning to fight Grendel unclothed. The Geats start chanting Beowulf's name, and the noise reaches Grendel's cave and he screams in pain.Back to the Hall, the torches go out, blue flames burst out of the hearth, and something pounds at the reinforced doors. Grendel comes crashing through as before, killing Geats left and right until Beowulf comes into the battle, in all his nakedness. Beowulf is very strong and agile, and knows how to fight Grendel (suggesting that the sea monster story wasn't entirely a bunch of hooey), and they spar back and forth until Beowulf notices that Grendel reacts painfully to loud noises. He promptly jumps onto Grendel's back and hammers at the beast's sensitive earpads, which causes the monster extreme pain. As Grendel tries to retreat, his arm is caught in some chains, and Beowulf grabs hold, preventing Grendel from escaping just as the monster goes out the big main door. Grendel's arm is pinned between the door and the doorjamb, and Beowulf, after victoriously announcing his name to the monster, rips off Grendel's arm. Grendel flees to his cave.Beowulf holds up the arm in victory, claiming he's killed Grendel, and most of the Geats cheer his name in celebration. Wiglaf does not, being much more concerned and upset with the lives lost in the battle.Back in the cave, Grendel is dying. We hear his mother asking who did this to him, and Grendel says Beowulf before he dies. Grendel's mother sings a lullaby as she carries her boys body to an altar of sorts. As she places the body down, her voice starts to crack and she sobs before starting to scream with rage.Back in Heorot, Hrothgar is holding another celebration in honor of Beowulf. Unferth apologizes for doubting him, and Wealthow is even more smitten with their hero. The King gives Beowulf a golden horn, the standard of the Danish kingdom, as part of his reward. The horn is in the shape of a dragon, with a red jewel at the neck, and Hrothgar makes an off-hand remark about how hitting the neck is the only way to kill a dragon. Wiglaf is still upset, and goes down to the shore to prepare their ship for departure the next morning.Later, the Geats are all passed out in the Hall after their celebration, and we get a first-persons view of Grendel's mother as she flies into the Hall and tries to figure out which man is Beowulf. She correctly singles out the man who is the biggest and strongest, and appears to him in a dream as Wealthow, begging Beowulf to give her a son. Beowulf realizes he is dreaming and wakes up just as Wealthow's face starts to turn into something demonic. He looks around the Hall to see that all of his men (except Wiglaf, who was down at the shore) have been slaughtered, their bodies strung from the rafters.Later on, when people start to suspect that Grendel isn't really dead, Hrothgar explains that the Geats were killed by Grendel's mother, about whom the King seems to know a great deal. When pressed about who is Grendels father, the King is evasive. It is implicitly clear that Hrothgar himself was Grendel's father (explaining why Grendel didnt kill him earlier). Unferth gives Beowulf his family's sword to assist him in killing Grendel's mother.Beowulf and Wiglaf set out for the cave to kill Grendel's mother and avenge their men. Beowulf insists on going in alone, golden horn and Unferth's sword in tow. The cave is dark, but the horn magically glows to light the way. Beowulf finds an alcove filled with gold, as well as a lot of human bodies, and the altar holding Grendel's body. Suddenly, Grendel's mother's voice comes out of nowhere asking who Beowulf is, and we see her slowly rise out of the water, apparently having shape-shifted into human form. Beowulf is rightly transfixed, in a manner very similar to when he saw the mermaid in his sea monster story. Beowulf's seems to be easily susceptible to the charms of the mystical lady-creatures.She admires how handsome and strong he is. Beowulf tries to run her through with Unferth's sword, but it just passes through her like shes a ghost. She comes up to him and tempts him with the promise of a kingdom and eternal glory, only if he lay with her and give her another son to replace the one he took. She grabs hold of Unferth's blade and it melts like butter. It is apparent that she could slaughter Beowulf at any time. Beowulf doesnt fight her as she sidles closer to him and grabs Hrothgar's dragon horn. There's clearly some kind of connection there, as she says that her promise is valid as long as she has that horn. And Beowulf seems on the verge of yielding to her offer.Jump cut to Beowulf marching back into Heorot, tossing Grendel's head at the Kings feet. Beowulf claims that he not only made sure Grendel is dead, but killed his mother, too. He claims he lost the horn while fighting her, and left Unferth's sword in her body to make sure that she stayed dead. Hrothgar gives Beowulf a quizzical look, and suddenly exclaims that since he, Hrothgar, has no heirs, everything he has, including the kingship and Wealthow, will go to Beowulf when he dies. Hrothgar throws another party, then asks Beowulf for a private word.The King asks Beowulf to recount exactly what happened with Grendel's mother. Beowulf repeats the same blustery tale as before, but with a bit of wariness in his voice. The insinuation is that Beowulf isn't being truthful about what happened. When Beowulf refers to Grendel's mother as a hag, Hrothgar gives him a knowing gotcha! look and says Shes no hag, Beowulf. We both know that. But shes not my curse anymore; she's yours. Beowulf, realizing that the King knows exactly what happened, is visibly shaken, but says nothing. They rejoin the party, but Hrothgar excuses himself later and promptly jumps off the castle wall to his death. As Beowulf and Wealthow look down in horror, Unferth announces Beowulf as Denmark's new King.We cut to Beowulf's face, older and grayer, wearing the Danish crown, surveying his soldiers on a field of battle. His soldiers are slaughtering the opposing army, and Beowulf seems almost saddened by the news. It seems that Grendel's mother made good on her promise, as Beowulf has enjoyed unsurpassed success and glory over the past 50 years, and Beowulf feels as his achievements are all empty and dishonorable, gained from an unholy union with a monster, rather than on Beowulf's own skill and merit. Beowulf even dares one of the enemy soldiers to try and kill him, knowing yet disappointed that it won't happen (it doesn't).Wealthow is Beowulf's Queen, but he has taken up with a younger girl, Ursula (Alison Lohman), who truly seems to care for Beowulf. Their relationship is kept secret with the Queen, thought she knows about it anyway and doesn't say anything. In fact, Beowulf and Wealthow seem to be in a cold and loveless marriage, and she doesnt seem the least bit relieved or happy to learn that he came back from battle unharmed. When Ursula asks what happened in their marriage, Wealthow says \"\"Too many secrets.\"\" One would think that she is just as disgusted with Beowulf for having sex with Grendel's mother as she was with Hrothgar.One night",Unferth comes to the King with a slave in tow. The slave holds out his hands to reveal Hrothgar's golden horn,which was found on the shore not too far from Grendel's cave. Beowulf is freaked out,as he realizes that this means that the deal with Grendel's mother is no longer in effect

Next, we see Lt. Aye (Aung Aay Noi) and a bunch of Burmese soldiers forcing civilians out of a truck. One soldier walks out to a rice field and throws an explosive into a swamp. He then throws a bunch of other explosives into the water while the civilians have their backs turned and their money taken. The soldiers order the civilians to go across the swamp. As they do, one person is blown up by one of the explosives. The others refuse to go on, and are shot to death by the soldiers.During the opening credits, we see John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) catching snakes in a jungle in Thailand. He also uses a bow-and-arrow to shoot a fish and then gives it to some fisherman passing by in their boat. Rambo and his helpers go to a snake village, where the owner pays Rambo for the snakes he captured. His only complaint though is for Rambo to get more pythons, since he keeps on bringing back cobras.While Rambo puts the snakes away, Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze) approaches him and introduces himself. Michael is a missionary, and he was told that Rambo is the boatman who knows the river best. Rambo says that its true, and Michael wants to hire him to bring him and his group to Burma. Rambo says that its a war zone, but Michael says that this is his fifth time going in and they are all aware of the dangers involved. Rambo asks him if they're bringing any weapons with them. Michael says no, and Rambo tells him that they're not going to change anything. Sarah (Julie Benz), one of the missionaries, tells Michael that shell try to persuade him. Sarah tries her best to convince Rambo to transport them to Burma, but he still refuses. He tells her to go home instead.Back in Burma, Lt. Aye's soldiers raid a village and take all the children hostage. The women cry and beg for their loved ones. Aye tells them that the boys will now be soldiers for the Burmese Army. He also threatens them that if any of the women try to get help from the rebels, they'll come back and cut out their tongues.In Thailand, Rambo and goes to his boat when he sees Sarah waiting for him. She again pleads with him to transport them to Burma, and he still refuses. She says that trying to save a life wont waste his, and he must still believe in something. After Sarah leaves, Rambo thinks about it and then changes his mind.The next day, Rambo and the missionaries travel down the river in his boat. Sarah thanks Rambo again for helping them, and then asks him what his name is. He says John, and she asks him where he's from. Rambo says that he's from Arizona, and he hasn't been back since he was drafted and served in the Vietnam War back in 1967. Sarah asks him if he's at least a little curious as to how his home has changed, but he tells her that he doesn't have a reason to be curious. He also mentions that his father might still be alive back home. Before Sarah returns to her seat, Rambo says that they shouldn't go on, and that they can turn back whenever she wants.At night, while the missionaries sleep, Rambo orders his passengers to be silent. Michael asks him what's wrong, and Rambo tells him he sees pirates nearby. He tells everyone to get down and be quiet so they can hopefully pass by unnoticed. They're almost in the clear, but the pirates spot them and open fire at them. Rambo stops the boat and tells everyone to keep their heads down. If they look the pirates in the eyes, they'll be killed. A pirate boat pulls up to them and several men hold everyone at gunpoint. They say that they're trespassing in their territory, and they have to pay them money. Rambo says that he'll pay him whatever they want from the boat, but then the pirates see that Sarah is female. They order Sarah to come with them, and Rambo offers them anything else but her. Tension escalates, and Rambo suddenly pulls a pistol and shoots all the pirates. One pirate is still alive, and so Rambo unloads his last bullets into his head. Michael voices his disapproval over what just happened, and so Rambo grabs him and tells him that if he didn't kill them, they would all be dead and Sarah would've been raped and probably killed as well. Rambo says that they're going to turn back, but Sarah wants them to continue on since they're so close. Rambo eventually agrees to go on, and they arrive in Burma the next day.While the missionaries get out, Michael says that he has to report Rambo for killing the pirates. He also says that they're going to take another way out instead of his boat, and so he doesn't have to wait for them. Sarah gives Rambo a crucifix necklace as a way of saying thank you for what he did. All the missionaries take off and hike to a village. As they do, Rambo travels back and comes across the pirate boat again. He douses it with gasoline and then lights it on fire, allowing it to explode with the dead pirates still on board.The missionaries get to the village, where they are greeted by the locals. One missionary is a dentist, and he inspects everyone's mouths. Another missionary hands out bibles and starts to preach about god while another missionary records him with his video camera. Sarah walks to where Michael is, where hes treating peoples wounds. Sarah looks at the people waiting to be looked at by Michael, who are missing legs and arms.Suddenly, explosions begin to rip through the village. Aye and his soldiers have arrived, and they proceed to slaughter everyone in sight. One missionary gets his legs blown off by an explosion. The unarmed civilians are shot to death. Some soldiers set the people on fire with flamethrowers. Children are brutally shot to death, and a soldier throws a woman's child into a burning hut. During the massacre, the remaining missionaries try to run away, but they are beaten and captured by the soldiers. Aye watches as the village burns and the ground is littered with corpses.Some time passes, and Rambo dreams about what has happened to him in the past. He is woken up by Arthur Marsh (Ken Howard), who calls out his name. Arthur apologizes for coming to him like this, but he wouldn't come if it wasn't important. Arthur is a reverend at the Colorado church where the missionaries are from. Before they left, Michael told him that Rambo was going to transport them to Burma. It's been a week since they were supposed to be back, but they never showed up. Arthur has been in contact with some Karen rebels, and they have a good idea of where they were taken. Rambo believes that they're probably dead, and recommends that Arthur talks to someone at the U.S. embassy in Thailand. He already has, and they won't help him in time. He has hired a bunch of mercenaries, and he wants Rambo to take them to the same spot where he dropped off the missionaries for a rescue mission. Rambo agrees to do it, and forges a large machete for himself.The next day, Rambo transports the mercenaries down the river. They are made up of Diaz (Reynaldo Gallegos), Reese (Jake La Botz), En-Joo (Tim Kang), and School Boy (Matthew Marsden) and are lead by Lewis (Graham McTavish), who constantly complains on how slow they are moving. Reese passes the time by singing, which annoys everyone else. The others pass the time with jokes and the like. Lewis tells Rambo that his boat is \"\"a piece of shit\"\"",and he could swim there faster than they are going. Rambo stares him down,but Lewis says that he does not impress him. School Boy introduces himself to Rambo,saying that he got his name in sniper school and he hasn't been able to get rid of it (regardless of how many people he's shot).They eventually get to the spot where Rambo dropped off the missionaries. Lewis is pissed

Among the other passengers are a photographer named Simon, a local Australian family of Elizabeth, Sherry, and Allen, a local couple named Gwen and Russell, an American couple named Mary Ellen and Everett, local tour guide Kate Ryan, and Kevin, her dog. After a run-in with two locals, Neil and Collin, the cruise winds to a close and Kate prepares to return the group to base.Everett spots a flare in the distance, and Kate tells the group that they must investigate to determine whether someone is in distress. A few miles up river, they come across a half-sunken boat when suddenly something crashes into the tourists' boat, creating a crack in the side. Kate's only choice is to run it ashore on a small island in the middle of the river. The group disembarks and begins discussion of what to do. Everett suddenly disappears, pulled into the water by an unseen predator. Kate comes to the conclusion that they are in the heart of a large crocodile's territory and that it will be more aggressive than usual. As the afternoon wears on, the tourists realize that the tide is rising: in a matter of hours their small island will be submerged.Neil and Collin arrive soon after and as they near the island, the 25-foot long crocodile smashes Neil and Collin's boat and sinks it. Neil manages to swim to the island safely, but Collin has disappeared.As night falls, Neil proposes that he swim to the mainland and string a rope between two trees, creating a zip-line to allow the group to cross above the river. Neil succeeds in setting up the rope and Mary Ellen crosses first only to freeze in fear halfway across. Allen becomes impatient and aggressive and attempts to get himself and Sherry across with Mary Ellen still on the line. While trying to secure the rope, Neil is attacked by the crocodile and gets eaten alive. The tree holding the rope snaps and the three on the line fall into the water. They scurry back to the island, but as Allen crawls up the beach, the gigantic crocodile suddenly lunges out of the water and throws him further into the river where he is also eaten alive.Later that night, Pete suggests they can delay the croc with a hook and bait on one side of the island while everyone escapes off the other side. Kate hooks two dead birds onto the boat's anchor while Pete secures the anchor rope to a boulder and throws the bait out into the river. After a long wait, the anchor is suddenly grabbed and pulled and the entire group jumps into the water and makes a break for the far shore. Pete tries to stop the boulder from being pulled over as Kate swims across behind the group. The croc suddenly lets go of the hook and bait, seizes Kate, and drags her underwater. Pete hurriedly makes the swim across the river with the dog Kevin in tow, and heads off into the bush to meet up with the others.As day breaks, Pete is crossing a stream when Kevin runs away. Pete chases the dog into a cave and falls down a narrow chute into a larger cave, where he sees Neil's partly eaten corpse. He quickly realizes that the cave is the crocodile's lair, and to his surprise, he finds Kate who is still alive but badly injured and unconscious with her part of her left leg and right arm missing having been eaten. He attempts to carry her out but has to hide when he hears the crocodile eating Kevin outside the cave. The huge crocodile then slowly enters the cave, laying down, and going to sleep. Trying to reach the entrance carrying Kate, Pete accidentally wakes the crocodile and it makes several attempts to devour both him and Kate as he retreats into the narrow confines of the cave. Finally, after a long fight in which he gets tossed around and is bitten in the hand, Pete makes one last stand. He braces a broken log against a large boulder with the sharp end pointing out towards the croc. The croc lunges at him, and Pete successfully impales it through the head killing it. He escapes from the cave with Kate to join the other tourists and waiting paramedics.As the credits roll, the camera zooms in on a newspaper article detailing Pete's heroic battle with the croc and rescue of Kate.",suspenseful,test,imdb
Season of the Witch,2011,95,Action,5.4,Dominic Sena,Bragi F. Schut,Christopher Lee,Nicolas Cage,Robert Sheehan,Stephen Graham,"Season of the Witch opens to show an ancient tome being carefully hand-copied in an unknown location.In the Austrian town of Villach, in 1235 AD, at a bridge over the river, a priest (Nicholas Sidi) is presiding over the execution of three women accused of witchcraft-- a young woman, a middle-aged midwife, and an older spinster. All three are shackled at the wrists and feet with heavy iron manacles. As the terrified young woman begs and pleads for mercy, a noose is tightened around her neck and the priest tells all three women that they still have time to confess their sins, and their souls will be saved. In desperation, the young woman confesses to everything the priest demands. The midwife pleads that she only used pig's fat to make an ointment. The spinster, however, lifts her head slowly and tells the father that he will burn in hell. The outraged priest signals to the church soldiers, who grab the spinster and shove her over the bridge, followed by the midwife. The young woman then finds out that the priest promised her SOUL would be saved, but her body must be consigned to God. Her terrified pleas fall on deaf ears as she is pushed over the edge of the bridge and the noose breaks her neck.The soldiers then take the ropes and lower all three bodies down into the river. The priest protests that he must read passages from the Book of Solomon so the bodies do not rise again, but the soldier commander (Rory McCann) says that the three women are both hanged and drowned, and that's dead enough for him.At dusk, the priest pulls the three bodies up by the ropes himself, to get them back onto the bridge. He pulls up the young woman first and reads the ritual from the book. As he does this for the midwife, near the end of the ritual her body begins to convulse and choke, before once again becoming still and silent. As he starts to pull up the body of the spinster, he finds the rope suddenly pulling back. A sharp yank causes the priest to tumble over the bridge onto the river. Floundering in the water, he manages to get to shore when he feels his foot grabbed. Screaming and flailing wildly, he scrambles back to the bridge and rushes back to the book of Solomon, scrambling to turn to a different section. The body of the spinster shoots up out of the water and stands erect before the frightened priest. Her face contorts horribly as she thrusts a hand forward, and the book bursts into flame. The priest is then seen being hanged from the bridge.The camera pans out over a battlefield in the Gulf of Edremit, during the Crusades in 1332 AD. Two knights of the Church, Behmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman), wait to rush into battle, good-naturedly wagering on who can slay more infidels (loser buys drinks at the tavern). The two fight with unmatched zeal on the battlefield against the Turks, and are later shown carousing in the tavern with ale and women. Over the years, the two knights fight in many more battles: at Tripoli in 1334, Imbros in 1337, and Artah in 1339. But as the years and battles pass, both knights start to wonder just how many enemies God must have, and start to question who is truly commanding these wars... God, or their mortal Church superiors.Then, during a siege on the Turk fortress at Smyrna in 1344, Behmen, for once does not look before he strikes... and impaled on his sword is no Turk soldier, but a young Turk peasant woman who was not running into battle, but running for her life. He and Felson both stop and stare in disbelief at the true scope of the casualties. At the end of the siege, Behmen has it out with the Grandmaster (Brían F. O'Byrne) of the Church army over the slaughter of the helpless women and children. Finally disillusioned with everything they'd been fighting for, Behmen and Felson walk away and leave the Church army.A month later, Behmen and Felson are walking along the coast of Styria. While searching for food, they find their way to a farmhouse and hope to barter for a meal there. They find a horrible sight-- the farmer and his wife have died of a horrible illness; their bodies covered with flies. The farm otherwise untenanted, Behmen and Felson are able to fill their stomachs and take two horses for themselves, burning the farmhouse and the bodies so the illness does not spread.They arrive at a town. Felson worries that they will be recognized as Church deserters, but they cannot afford to ride past-- the horses are farm animals and cannot carry them much further. They have to barter the horses for provisions, food and perhaps proper riding horses.But inside the town, they quickly find the hand of death laying heavily upon it. The streets are clogged with the bodies of dead people being lain there as the remaining populace struggles with the task of burying or burning the corpses. A dreadful plague has gripped the village; wiping people out by the dozens. Three and a half years the pestilence has ravaged the countryside.Felson and Behmen are bartering with a stableman for fresh horses. But as a young stable boy picks up Behmen's bundle, Behmen's crusader sword falls out and onto the ground, its crest clearly visible. Behmen quickly grabs the bundle back up, but it is too late-- the stable master has seen the crest. As Behmen and Felson try to hurry out of the town, several soldiers corner them. Behmen and Felson fight, but are too severely outnumbered, and are captured and arrested. But as they are being escorted to the Church dungeon, a priest named Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore) asks to see Behmen's sword. Looking at the crest, he orders that Behmen and Felson follow him.Debelzaq brings the two men into the church temple, where they stand before Cardinal D'Ambroise (Christopher Lee), who is ill with the plague, being tended to by priests. D'Ambroise and Debelzaq say that the plague was brought about by a Black Witch, whose confession was heard by Debelzaq. D'Ambroise says that the witch must be brought to the Abbey of Severac, where the monks possess the last copy of a book of rituals that will destroy the witch's powers and thus end the plague. D'Ambroise wants Behmen and Felson to join Debelzaq and Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen), who is D'Ambroise's best knight, in escorting the Black Witch to Severac. When Behmen says he swore oath to God, but no longer serves the Church or its soldiers who murder in God's name, D'Ambroise and Debelzaq have them placed in the dungeon to await execution for desertion.In a cell across from Felson and Behmen is the accused Black Witch-- who, as she lifts her head to look at them, seems to Behmen to merely be a frightened young woman (Claire Foy). He brushes off the point that Debelzaq heard the Girl confess by mentioning that the Church can be most persuasive.Later that night, the Girl is seen briefly watching Behmen while he sleeps. Behmen is haunted by his memory of killing a peasant Turk woman at the Battle of Smyrna. Awakening from the dream, he sees the Girl accused of witchcraft sobbing fearfully as she lays in her cell across from him.Moved by compassion, Behmen calls for Debelzaq and tells him he will deliver the Girl to Severac. In return he wants a promise that she will be given a fair trial. Because Behmen is doing this in the interest of true justice, and not as a favor for the Church, they have no choice but to agree to his demand... and to Felson's term that he and Behmen are fully pardoned.Behmen and Felson are taken to the library and shown the travel route to Severac, which is six days' travel distance. The travel route is treacherous, passing across a river gorge, through a forest called Wormwood from which men have never found their way out of, and along a steep mountain pass... and Debelzaq is not familiar with the travel route. Behmen insists that a guide be hired or conscripted; a merchant or tax collector who travels and knows the areas along the route.Debelzaq (reluctantly) brings Behmen and Felson to a man named Hagamar (Stephen Graham), who is locked in a pillory for swindling Church officials; though of course, Hagamar insists he is innocent. Behmen, once again speaking as a knight, tells Hagamar that the bailiff of the town will issue him a full pardon if he guides the party escorting the Girl, to Severac. Behmen warns Hagamar that he will personally slay him if Hagamar tries to flee at any time.The party goes to the dungeon to retrieve the Girl and prepare her for transport. As the cell is unlocked, Debelzaq says that the Girl is unconscious, as the food she was given for her last meal was spiked with a powerful sedative. But as Debelzaq kneels over her and touches her neck, she springs up, seizing the priest by the throat, and shoving him down to the ground. Hearing Eckhart starting to draw his sword, the Girl turns and lunges at him, grabbing him by his own throat and throwing him down to the ground. Behmen manages to grab the Girl, though it takes Felson's aid for him to hold her fast. Hearing Debelzaq's voice, the Girl suddenly stops fighting long enough for Behmen to club her on the back of her head and knock her out.The Girl is placed in a cage built into a wagon which will be driven to the abbey. As the party sets out, townspeople curse at the Girl and throw offal at the cage. Meanwhile, at the Church temple, Cardinal D'Ambroise has died. A young soldier watches sadly as he is prepared for burial.As the escort party rides, Eckhart (who is driving the wagon) asks Debelzaq how he came across the Girl. Debelzaq found her wandering about Marburg, muttering strange and unintelligible words... and the plague came within a fortnight, and then to every village she passed. Eckhart is unconvinced that this makes her a witch, because he never saw the Girl pass by his own village, and yet the plague came just the same.Riding on horseback behind the wagon, Behmen and Felson talk. Though there is little if any other evidence to suggest that the Girl is a witch, Behmen cannot argue Felson's point that when she struggled with them, she displayed far greater physical strength than a girl her size and build should have. Of even greater concern at the moment, however, is that Felson has noted that the party is being followed.They set an ambush and corner the pursuer, ordering him off his horse. Behmen uses his sword to push down the pursuer's hood, revealing the face of the altar boy who was grieving over Cardinal D'Ambroise. The young man says his name is Kay (pronounced 'Kye,' played by Robert Sheehan), the son of a knight named Jurand, who fought at the battle of Imbros. Kay wants to come with the party to Severac, in the hopes that on the party's return, he will have a sponsor toward being knighted himself. Felson laughs mockingly at the request, seeing Kay as only an altar boy. This makes Kay speak defiantly in Felson's face; the argument reaching an impasse that can only be resolved by a duel, although Behmen requests that Felson use his off-hand and pull his blows; Behmen does not want Kay slain, but merely sent on his way.But although Kay is not Felson's equal in either swordplay or brute force, he fights with a valor that impresses Behmen; enough that he agrees to Kay joining the escort party.That night at camp, Behmen tells Kay tales of how he and Felson came to enlist in the Crusades. Later, Behmen goes to the Girl to bring her food and a blanket. Receiving them with gratitude, the Girl confides in Behmen that Debelzaq tortured her unmercifully before she confessed to him. She is frightened of Severac, telling Behmen of how another girl in her village was put on 'trial' for witchcraft: she was tied up, weighted down with stones and cast into a lake; because she did not drown, she was declared guilty and burned at the stake. Trying to comfort the Girl, Behmen promises that she will receive a fair trial. As Behmen returns to camp, Debelzaq tries to warn him that the witch is a deceiver who will turn men against one another.Later that night, Debelzaq's words seem to already begin to ring true. He goes to relieve Eckhart, who was watching over the Girl. As Eckhart watches her sleep, he speaks to Debelzaq about how much the Girl reminds him of his own daughter, Mila, who died from the plague (as he speaks, the Girl briefly opens one eye, showing she is awake and can hear the conversation). He is also concerned about the cardinal's promise to Behmen that the Girl would receive a fair trial: D'Ambroise also vowed to end the plague, and the town, so badly decimated by the pestilence and desperate for someone to blame, would riot if the Girl were to be found innocent. He is sure that the monks at Severac would decide based on what was best for the Church, instead of in the interest of justice, and Eckhart wants no further part of it.As Eckhart begins to return the camp, the Girl fearfully begs him not to leave her alone with Debelzaq. Quickly Eckhart notes that she is terrified of the priest and starts to approach her cage. But he gets too close and the Girl seizes him, pulling him against the bars of the cage. Without thinking, Debelzaq rushes to Eckhart's aid, but with cat-quick reflexes, the Girl releases Eckhart and grabs Debelzaq, grabbing a key to the cage from off of him and driving his cloak's pin clean through his hand. The rest of the party hears Debelzaq's screams and rushes out to recapture the Girl.The party tracks the Girl to a village decimated by the plague, and splits up to find her. As Kay and Eckhart pause at the site of a mass grave, Eckhart suddenly begins to hear his daughter Mila calling out to him and runs about in a desperate attempt to find her. Seeing Mila in front of him, Eckhart rushes toward her-- but it is in fact not Mila there, but a surprised Kay, who turned around just in time for Eckhart to impale himself on Kay's sword. Even as he dies, Eckhart thinks he sees Mila in front of him.As Behmen and Felson converge, they hear the Girl beginning to cry. Felson finds her, and she wrestles him to the ground. Behmen throws her off of him and she huddles against a wall, sobbing tearfully as she begs Behmen not to let Debelzaq touch her again.After giving Eckhart a Church burial, Debelzaq warns Behmen about the Girl, believing she killed Eckhart. He points out that she overheard Eckhart telling him about Mila, and that Kay noted that Eckhart's mind was not his own when he died. Debelzaq is most wary of any others in the party telling the Girl anything about themselves... for she will see the weaknesses in all of their hearts, and use these weaknesses against them. As they turn to look at the Girl, she glances at them curiously... but after Behmen turns to mount his horse, her expression toward Debelzaq changes to a thin, sly smile.The party rides along a mountainside road. The Girl speaks to Behmen as he rides behind the wagon, thanking him for his bravery and demeanor toward her. Her tone of voice with Behmen has changed from timid and wary to one of casual familiarity. When Behmen tells her that Debelzaq feels she killed Eckhart, she protests that Eckhart always treated her kindly, while Debelzaq has been anything but kind. Saying that she feels the pain in Behmen's heart over Eckhart's death, she stretches a hand out, offering to ease his pain. Behmen's face turns distrustful and she backs off and lays down.Meanwhile, Debelzaq is trying to soothe Kay's guilt, but the young soldier cannot be comforted. He holds himself responsible.The party arrives at a bridge they must cross; finding it dilapidated and rickety; unlike the last time Hagamar remembered crossing it-- eight or nine years ago. As Felson starts to question Hagamar's ability as a guide, Behmen starts to lead his horse across the bridge; testing its ability to bear both his and the horse's weight. The bridge sways, creaks and groans, but Behmen makes it across. He instructs the rest of the party to completely unload the wagon (except of course, for the Girl), and to bring the horses across first, one by one.Kay and Behmen begin pulling the wagon across, while Felson, Debelzaq and Hagamar hold a rope fastened to the rear of the wagon, gradually letting it out. Behmen and Kay are barely halfway across when the rough hemp rope abrades Delbezaq's hands until they are bloody and he is unable to hold on. Without his added pull and weight against the rope, Felson and Hagamar cannot hold on, causing the wagon to lurch uncontrollably across the bridge. Kay loses his balance and tumbles over the side of the bridge... but before he can fall, the Girl thrusts her hand through the bars of her cage and grasps his wrist, pulling Kay to safety-- with only one hand. The party hitches a rope from the horses to the wagon so they can pull it the rest of the way across; the party members pushing from behind. The bridge finally gives way under the stress, the party barely making it safely across with the wagon. As they pause to rest and bandage Debelzaq's hands, Hagamar notes that they are at the entrance to Wormwood Forest.As the party rides on, fog lays heavily upon the ground and Hagamar cannot see where they are going. Felson and Hagamar start to argue again when Behmen suggests they camp on the road until the fog passes. As camp is set up, Behmen goes to confront the Girl. Though she has displayed no other powers, Kay is now living proof of her incredible strength.The Girl's tone and face as she looks at Behmen have changed again, and she addresses him almost as if he were a friend, saying that people will believe what they want to believe. Addressing Behmen by name this time, she asks him if he believes she is a witch. As she speaks, the torch in Behmen's hands seems to abruptly go out, and then continue burning. In the brief second that his eyes were off the Girl, she has leaned against the bars, offering an amused smile as she asks if Behmen is afraid of her. Behmen pulls a tarp over her cage so they cannot see her, and she cannot look into their eyes. While asleep, Behmen has another dream of killing the peasant woman at Smyrna... but this time, as he remembers impaling her on his sword, he dreams that, instead of falling dead, she touches her fingers to her wound and tastes her blood, smiling pleasurably.Waking from the dream, Behmen finds Hagamar loading a crossbow; he is preparing to kill the Girl then and there, planning to deliver a cover story that she escaped from the cage and tried to attack them, and they had to kill her in self-defense. Behmen and Felson stop him, saying that even if nobody else could discern the deception of the story, Behmen and Felson themselves-- along with Debelzaq-- would always know and remember it.Abruptly a piercing ululation, sounding as if the Girl were howling, interrupts the argument. A more lupine howl comes from the forest, followed by another, and then more. The party knows that a pack of wolves is converging on them. Quickly they mobilize and stand in a formation that will let them cover each other's backs. The pack comes charging into the camp, but the party members defend themselves and each other, slaying the wolves.Then another chorus of howls comes from the forest and the party sees that the wolves are going to make another go for the camp, in even greater numbers. Behmen jumps to take the reins of the wagon while everyone else rides behind him. Chasing the party with determination, the pack of wolves succeeds in pulling down Hagamar's horse. As they surround Hagamar, their eyes and muzzles contort until they look horrific. Behmen and Felson start to ready their weapons, but the savage beasts are devouring Hagamar and they cannot save him. Taking back to flight again, they escape.The next day the party is riding again, when suddenly Behmen stops the wagon and grabs the crossbow. He has decided to kill the Girl himself and put an end to the party members dying. But of all the people to come to try and stop him, Debelzaq pleads with Behmen to stay his hand. Behind Debelzaq, the Girl smiles with seeming delight as she listens to Behmen rage at Debelzaq about how much more blood he's spilled in God's name, than he now believes God would ask him to do. Behman shoves Debelzaq aside, but now it is Felson standing before the cage. Felson gestures to one side, showing Behmen that they are at the edge of Wormwood Forest, and just before them is the mountain pass... and their destination, the Abbey of Severac, is in sight.Riding up to the abbey, Behmen knocks on the door for the outer gate. When nobody answers, Kay finally climbs through a window to open it from the inside. They ride through the outer cloister and Debelzaq says that judging by the time of day, they should find the monks in the chapel; they would be in vespers now.But on arrival, Debelzaq, Behmen, Felson and Kay find only death. The monks there are all dead from the plague. Debelzaq is distraught, as there is nowhere else to go. He drops to his knees and fervently begins to recite the Lord's prayer, when suddenly they hear a strained voice softly speak the last sentence. They find one monk on the floor, barely clinging to life. Debelzaq starts to give the dying monk last rites, when the monk shakily points to where Behmen sees the Book of Solomon resting on an altar. Debelzaq feels new hope as he skims through the pages.The party returns to the wagon, which they have left just outside the chapel gates; Debelzaq holding the Book of Solomon. At this point, all traces of timidity are gone from the Girl's voice and face, and she faces them with increasing boldness as she asks if this is the fair trial she was promised. Debelzaq sprinkles holy water at her, which makes her recoil, and begins the ritual. Smiling as she says she's deceived Debelzaq, the Girl then lashes out hatefully and begins to castigate the whole party on the Church's own sins and all the people it has hanged, burned and crucified.The Girl pauses to shoot a glance over her shoulder at the wagon's horses, who immediately respond with great agitation. She resumes her vitriol before Behmen tells Debelzaq to continue the ritual. As he begins reading, the girl briefly closes her eyes and mouths words. Debelzaq's injured hands begin to bleed and throb with pain. Behmen draws his sword and starts to advance on the Girl, who lashes out at his trying to help her only as a means of easing his own guilt. Behmen stops short on seeing she knew about his slaying the peasant Turk woman. The Girl's smile turns completely savage as she declares Behmen's own sins to be Legion in number; the countless souls that fell beneath his blade.Suddenly the Girl stands as erect as the cage will permit her and begins to bark the words of the Crusader Grandmaster during the battle of Smyrna-- her voice now mimicking that of the Grandmaster perfectly. Behmen and Felson stare in astonishment. Even without her voice having perfectly copied that of the Crusader Grandmaster, how she was able to know the exact words of his monologue should be impossible.Debelzaq's face turns in horror and he softly says that the Girl is in fact, no witch... he knows that she is something far more terrible. He hurriedly turns the pages of the Book of Solomon to one with a demonic image and the Latin word for exorcisms.As Debelzaq reads, the Girl turns, shrieking at him not to speak the words. Debelzaq starts to read the ritual more loudly, more strongly, and the Girl starts to scream and scramble about her cage. Winds begin to pick up; dark clouds blot out the sun. Slowly the Girl's face and body begin to change; revealing the demon that has possesed her. The demon grips the bars of the cage and they begin to melt, along with the roof and floor of the cage. Now free, the demon makes a beeline for Debelzaq; striking both Behmen and Felson aside like swatting at bugs. In desperation, Debelzaq grabs the goblet of holy water and hurls it at the demon, and it emits a horrible scream of agony. Kay rushes forward, sword at the ready, but the demon takes to the air and flees into the monastery.The party holes up in the abbey and gathers more holy water. Behmen tells Kay that his journey is ending here; the battle that must be undertaken now is beyond him. But Kay insists that his honor cannot be upheld unless he completes his vow to them, even if they try to release him from it... and even if it means his own death. Moved by Kay's valor and sense of duty, Behmen draws his sword, asks Kay to kneel and speak the vows of knighthood after him; upon which Behmen gives the accolade, using his authority as a knight to bestow knighthood on Kay.As the party goes through the abbey to confront the demon, they all reflect and think about their journey. The demon could have escaped at any time, but didn't. Kay realizes that escape was never the demon's plan. The party remembers that Eckhart died only after he began to express severe doubt over the Girl's guilt as a witch, and whether they truly needed to bring her to the abbey. Hagamar was killed by the wolves only after he wanted to kill the Girl immediately at the camp site in Wormwood. And reflecting further, they remember that when she struggled with them in her cell before the start of the journey, she suddenly stopped fighting, allowing them to render her unconscious when Debelzaq shouted that the sooner they got her to Severac, the better. Throughout the journey, she actually helped them-- even going so far as saving Kay's life. Putting these details together, the party realizes that the demon WANTED the party to deliver it to the abbey, even aiding them in reaching the destination safely.Making their way to the library, the party finds more bodies of monks that have succumbed to the plague. Behmen is puzzled to find that one monk, before dying, bound himself to the chair his corpse still sits in. More dead monks are found, similarly bound to their chairs in front of their desks. On the desks themselves are sheets of parchments containing passages from the Book of Solomon. Behmen and Debelzaq realize that the monks were making copies of the book, to arm the rest of Europe against evil, heresy and witchcraft. This gives them the answer as to why the demon wanted to come here to the abbey: it knew that a suspected witch would be brought here, where the last copy of the Book of Solomon was kept. The demon's goal, all along, has been to destroy the last copy of the book before more copies were finished. It would have free, unopposed reign over all of Europe, and usher in an age of darkness.The demon (now voiced by Kevin Killebrew) speaks directly to them then, dryly thanking them for bringing it to the abbey and the book before it. They see the demon in its true form perched on the domed ceiling of the abbey library.Abruptly the papers on all the desks burst into flame and begin to burn. The increased illumination from these small fires allows Felson to note something terribly disturbing... all the bodies of the dead monks are now gone.Debelzaq starts to continue reading the ritual. The demon growls and causes a stone banister above them to crumble and crash down on their heads. Then, the party notes, the dead bodies of the monks are now animated, under the demon's command. The dead monks quickly scuttle along the walls and ceiling of the library, dropping down on them to kill them.Fighting to destroy these animated corpses, and to defend Debelzaq as he continues the exorcism ritual, the party finds that cutting the heads off of the corpses causes them to dissipate. But the last body drops from the ceiling right on Felson's back, driving a knife into it. Felson destroys the last dead monk, but is grievously wounded.Suddenly the demon itself descends from the chapel dome. In the fighting, Debelzaq was now unguarded. Seizing Debelzaq from above and behind, the demon snaps his neck and kills him. It tries to grab the book to destroy it, but the holy writing on the pages burns its hand. Behmen rushes at the demon, but it grabs Behmen by the throat and pins him against the wall, hissing how the book has tormented it over centuries as it worked tirelessly to destroy all the copies, and this was the last one. The demon throttles Behmen harder, about to finish him, when suddenly Felson grabs the demon from behind, saying to Behmen, 'you'll be buying tonight, my friend.'Felson drags the demon away from Behmen, but he is no match for the demon's physical strength or unholy powers. Enveloping Felson in its wings, the demon burns Felson alive, turning his body into ash.The demon's head whirls around at the sound of Latin incantations; Kay has picked up the book and has picked up the ritual where Debelazaq left off. Enraged, it turns to face the young knight, when Behmen charges at the demon, shoving it against the wall, driving two daggers through the demon's wings to pin it. Struggling with all his strength, Behmen shouts for Kay to finish the ritual. As the young knight recites with renewed conviction, the demon begins to shriek loudly and fight with maniacal fury. Arcing one wing around, the demon uses a barb along the wing's edge, stabbing Behmen in the back. It drives the barb into Behmen's back again and again, ripping Behmen apart from the inside out. Finally Behmen is mortally wounded, and the demon bats him aside and pulls the knives out of its wings, turning to face its last opponent... but Kay has finished reading the exorcism ritual with a loud, forceful Amen. The demon is halted in its tracks; the holy power invoked wracking the demon with great pain, finally destroying it; the horrific unholy creature's body becoming a ball of energy that dissipates through the domed ceiling. Quickly the sky begins to clear.The battle won, Kay slumps in a daze against a wall while the Girl lays naked and barely conscious nearby. Kay crosses to Behmen. With his dying breath, Behmen asks Kay to watch over and protect the Girl.Kay provides proper Church burial for his fallen compatriots, building stone barrows into which are set Felson and Behmen's swords and a wooden cross as grave markers. The Girl stands beside him, musing how she owes so much to those that she never truly knew, and she doesn't know what to say. Kay suggests she say what is in her heart.The Girl tells the slain knights that her name is Anna, and she will never forget everything they did for her; how they gave their lives on her behalf. She asks Kay to tell her everything he knows about Behmen, Felson and Debelzaq, as she and Kay mount horses for the journey home. We see the Book of Solomon in Kay's saddle bag; he is now the keeper of the words of Solomon. The camera begins to pan out as Kay and Anna ride back to civilization.Anna closes the movie with a voiceover in which she recounts that the plague lifted from the land like the passing of a fever, and she promises to devote her life to telling her story, that the horrors faced and the lives lost will always be remembered and that people will be reminded that they, and the darkness that almost was, were all very real.","paranormal, suspenseful, gothic",val,imdb

She shoots him with his own gun, the same one that killed Frank, confessing that she committed that murder.

Olympus and imprisoned the vanquished -- the Titans -- beneath Mt. Tartarus on Earth. Also lost during the battle is the Bow of Epirus, a mighty weapon that can shoot invincible energy arrows.Centuries later, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) mounts a campaign to recover the Bow of Epirus and free the Titans. Bitter over the deaths of his wife and children due to disease, he is resolved to destroy the gods who refused his prayers to spare his family. He overtakes the Sybelline Monastery, imprisoning the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and her attendants, then lays waste to villages in the area. In one village works the stone mason Theseus (Henry Cavil). Theseus has been trained in the military arts by a mysterious Old Man (John Hurt) who encourages him to be a protector of all humanity; Theseus, whose devout mother was raped and thus considered an outcast, refuses. When the goddess Athena (Isabel Lucas) visits the Old Man, he is revealed to be Zeus (Luke Evans) in human disguise.When Hyperion's forces destroy Theseus's village, he kills Theseus's mother in front of him and imprisons Theseus, where Phaedra and her attendants are also kept. Phaedra inadvertently touches Theseus and has a vision of him as either the savior of humanity or the ally of Hyperion in the destruction of the world. That night, she and her attendants seduce and kill the guards; Phaedra escapes with Theseus and two other slaves, Stavros (Steven Dorff) and Daerios (Alan Van Spring).Although Zeus has forbidden the gods to intervene unless the Titans are freed, Athena, Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and Ares (Daniel Sharman) determine to protect Theseus as best they can. Phaedra tells Theseus he must return to his village and properly bury his mother. There, Theseus discovers the Bow of Epirus. Hyperion has sent the Minotaur (Robert Maillet) and soldiers to intercept them. The soldiers kill Daerios but, after a brutal battle with the Minotaur, Theseus uses the Bow to free the others. That night, Phaedra makes love to Theseus to free herself from her premonitory powers.The humans make their way to the Sybelline Monastery, where Hyperion has laid another trap. A jackal steals the Bow of Epirus and takes it to Hyperion, but the timely arrival of Athena and Ares saves Thesus, Phaedra and Stavros. This enrages Zeus who kills Ares in punishment but allows Athena to provide horses to Theseus so he can join a last stand against Hyperion's forces.As Theseus leads the fight against Hyperions' army, Hyperion uses the Bow to free the Titans from their prison. This prompts Zeus to intervene, and he, Athena, Poseidon, Heracles and Apollo fight a ferocious battle against the Titans. Theseus confronts Hyperion and, though mortally wounded, finally kills him. The Titans kill all of the gods except Zeus who destroys Mt. Tartarus to contain them again. Zeus takes Athena and Theseus to Olympus with him.Several years later, Phaedra lives in Theseus's village with her son, the result of her coupling with Theseus. The Old Man approaches the boy and tells him to prepare for a coming war in heaven.

She hasn't gotten caught because she hacked the school's server and gave herself perfect attendance. Dave is dealing with being a high school senior and an increase in fatigue and boredom, even around his friends Marty (Clark Duke) and Todd (Augustus Prew). Additionally, other individuals have gone around dressed as superheroes, inspired by Dave's heroism. Dave asks Mindy to help him continue training to become as good a fighter as she is, which means she subjects him to a lot of beatings and bullets to the chest.Meanwhile, the spoiled and rotten Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has moved to Long Island and is still seeking revenge against Kick-Ass for the death of his father (in the previous film). He complains to his mother Angie (Yancy Butler) and his new bodyguard/driver Javier (John Leguizamo) about her removing a news report on Kick-Ass from the DVR.

Marcus overhears on the radio that someone fitting the description of Hit-Girl is on the run, and he calls Mindy, who fakes sick and rushes home on her motorcycle before Marcus gets home.

Marcus tells her it is time for her to be done with Hit-Girl for good.Dave finds Mindy at school the next day and tries to talk to her, but she says she's sorry for ditching him and nearly getting him killed, and that she is done with Hit-Girl. Unfortunately, everybody overhearing this conversation thinks Mindy is breaking up with Dave.

He contacts another costumed citizen named Dr. Gravity (Donald Faison), who claims to be a physics professor (he's not) who has a weapon that levitates objects (it's a baseball bat wrapped in tin foil).

They send the thugs away, and Dr. Gravity invites Kick-Ass to join his team of heroes.At the same time, Chris has donned his mother's S&M gear and fashioned himself a super villain costume, calling himself...The Motherfucker. His first act as a villain is to try and spread the word of his crimes by robbing a convenience store, but he's pissed to find there are no cameras around. He instead starts shooting the beverages, even hitting himself in the eye with his gun because of the recoil.Marcus, deciding that Mindy needs to live a normal life as a teenage girl, takes her to her first slumber party at the home of the high school's queen bee, Brooke (Claudia Lee), joined by Brooke's two shallow friends Harlow (Tanya Fear) and Dolce (Ella Purnell).

The teacher speaks about chance encounters and how love at first sight can affect us. One boy says it would make him feel regret for not trying to talk to the other person. Adèle listens to all the discussion impassively.During lunch with her friends, they gush about sex while Adèle just listens. A boy, named Thomas (Jérémie Laheurte) looks at Adèle and smiles. Her girlfriends tell her that it is obvious that hes into her and she should do something about it, forcing her to take a look at him. But Adèle doesn't seem to be very interested in him. Shes actually quite detached. That evening at home, Adèle has dinner with her parents and discusses her day. She later writes in her diary and then goes to sleep.The next day, Adèle gets on the bus where Thomas joins her. They start a conversation and Adèle begins to loosen up. She learns Thomas is a senior (she's a junior, one year below) and that he hopes to study music later in life at a university. They begin to talk about music. Adèle says she loves all kinds but hard rock, as she stereotypes it as men with long hair who scream into microphones. Thomas laughs and says they apparently have a problem because he happens to like that kind of music. However, maybe it will give them an excuse to hang out again someday soon as Adèle notes, maybe the stuff he loves is different than her preconceived notions.Later, on a different day, Adèle about to cross the road when she sees a woman with blue-colored hair with her arms around another woman. As people cross the streets, Adèle turns her head to look at the woman, who in turn turns her head and smiles at Adèle. Adèle is stunned to feel a connection to a woman she has never met.Adèle then meets Thomas in order to hang out. They get lunch and talk about the book Adèle is reading for class, 'The Life of Marianne'. Adèle notes she hates when teachers over-analyze the book for her, thus taking away all the mystery and suspense. Thomas admits he hasn't read too many books but loved reading 'Dangerous Liaisons' in class since his professor was able to break down things he missed. Thomas promises to read 'The Life of Marianne' for her, as he is completely enamored with Adèle.Thomas and Adèle go to the movies. Thomas goes to hold her hand and kiss her neck and mouth. Adèle lets him a little but her heart isn't into it.That night, as she sleeps, Adèle begins to dream of the blue haired woman touching and kissing her. Adèle begins to masturbate in her sleep, touching her breasts and genitals, breathing deep. In the middle of it all, she wakes up startled. She can't believe what she was feeling.The next day, her friends want details in regards to Thomas, thinking the two slept together. Adèle denies that they did and finally leaves when she gets tired of their questions. Thomas follows into the school and asks if he did something wrong or that he went too fast because he really likes her. Adèle, desperately wanting to try and be normal with a boy who likes her, kisses him back.In the next scene Adèle and Thomas are seen in his bedroom and both of them are naked. They begin to have sex, which is apparently Adèle's first time ever. As they get into it, Adèle seems to enjoy it quite a bit. When it is over however, Adèle has a distant, detached look on her face. Perhaps, despite her desire to just be a normal girl who likes boys, it isn't enough or rather it is not the right thing for her. Thomas asks her if she is okay and if the sex was good. Adèle says that is was and kisses him. She lets him hold her.Adèle talks to her gay friend Valentin (Sandor Funtek) about unhappy she is with Thomas, because she feels as if she needs to fake it. She also notes she looks awful and Thomas would break up with her on that alone; she and Valentin joke about how this will be how her relationship ends. However, this gives her only a respite from reality. She will have to face him soon enough. Adèle smokes a cigarette at school before going to meet Thomas.In the next shot, Adèle and Thomas are sitting on a school bench. Adèle has told him that it isn't working for her but she never meant to hurt him. Thomas is visibly upset, however, he lets their relationship end without any objections. He then leaves.At home later that night, Adèle cries on her bed. She is confused over her emotions, and feels awful that she hurt a boy that only liked her and did her no harm. Adèle is now at a low point of her young life.Later, Adèle joins her friends during a student protest in the streets. She lets herself get caught up in it so she can forget her problems for a while.At school, Adèle sits in a stairwell and smokes a cigarette. A young woman, from her group of friends sits down next to her and bums a light from her. As another girl passes, the woman comments that the girl has a nice ass. Adèle scoffs at the comment, and the young woman says she thinks Adèle is the cutest girl in their year. Adèle blushes and the young woman tilts Adèle's face her way and kisses her on the lips to Adèle's surprise.At dinner that night, Adèle's mother notices a chance in her daughter, noting that she apparently had a good day. Adèle just smiles.The next day at school after class, Adèle tracks the girl down in the ladies restroom and when no one is around, starts to kiss her. The girl however does not respond to it. The girl then tells Adèle that she didn't mean for her to get addicted to it, and her kissing Adèle was just some harmless fun, making it clear she wanted nothing more. However, she tells Adèle that nothing will change with them and she will not tell their other friends, keeping her secret. Adèle is crushed, thinking she found a potential confidant/partner.Ignoring most of her gal pals, Adèle grabs Valentin and asks to go out with him that night. Valentin takes her to a gay club, where Adèle watches gay men dance and kiss. She is bewildered by it all but also sad because she doesn't have that type of connection in her own life. Seeing a woman that looks like the blue-haired girl she saw on the street, Adèle leaves the club, following the group of women to another bar.When she gets there, she realizes it is a lesbian bar. She gets a few looks and some of the women flirt with her. Adèle is a bit embarrassed by the attention and goes up to the bar and orders a beer. Looking up to the loft area she sees the very same blue haired-woman from that day. The woman sees her too and grins. The woman comes down and after deflecting another woman from talking to Adèle, begins to chat with her. The blue-haired woman introduces herself as Emma (Léa Seydoux).Emma tells Adèle that it is obvious that she is new to the scene given that she ordered a Bulldog, which a \"\"dyke beer\"\". Emma gives her a taste of her strawberry milk drink",to which Adèle admits she finds gross. Emma tells Adèle they don't get too many of her type in the bar. Adèle asks what type she is. Emma says the underage type. Adèle asks about what Emma does for a living and Emma replies she is 22-years-old and is in her fourth year of college,studying Fine Arts. They have a discussion of the various types of art and if there is such a thing as bad art. Adèle meanwhile admits she is still in high school as well as her real age of being only 16-years-old. Emma's friends walk up and tell her they are going to another club and want her to come. Emma introduces Adèle as her cousin to them. Emma then leaves,but not before getting Adèle to tell her the name of her high school that she attends.The next day

Back in Dusty's hometown of Propwash Junction, the entire town is getting ready for the annual Corn Fest, which Dusty will be racing in. While talking to other vehicles about the upcoming festival, including his faithful fuel truck friend Chug, and the towns only fire engine Mayday, Dusty's friend and flying coach Skipper invites Dusty to go fly, which he happily agrees.The two depart the runway and begin flying over the town and following country side. Dusty practices aerobatic maneuvers and high speed passes over the ground. While in a steep climb, Dusty begins to experience an engine failure. As he panics and stalls, Skipper rushes in to help. Dusty recovers, but continues to struggle with a damaged engine. The two make an uneventful landing and proceed to Dusty's mechanic, Dottie.While in the hanger, Dusty denies doing anything to possibly damage himself. Dottie expresses her frustration with Dusty's racing habits, and begins to lecture him, even though he appears to be ignoring her. Dottie's expression suddenly turns to a look of horror as she discovers that a critical component of his engine is failing. She explains to Dusty that he needs a gearbox replacement, which has been out of production for sometime and she is unable to fabricate a new one. Dottie explains that Dusty cannot use more than 80% of his engines power, which leaves him unable to race ever again.Later that night at the local bar, Dusty and Skipper cope with the bad news over a can of oil. Chug arrives and offers good news. They contacted a several repair shops in the area and are going to look for any replacement gearbox in storage. They all celebrate the news as Dusty's old boss Leadbottom arrives. After hearing the news of Dusty not racing again, he offers his old job back. Dusty's friends stand by Dusty's dreams and say that he isn't a crop duster anymore, but when they look they realize he slipped out quietly.Dusty is seen flying over the town at high speeds, pushing his engine to the limits. As he approaches red line, he gets a warning light (recently installed by Dottie to warn if his engine is over 80%) and backs off the throttle. Distracted, he clips a power wire and spins wildly. He attempts to recover and careens down the runway crashing into a hanger. As the local residents wake up to the commotion, a small fire has started with leaking fuel. Mayday, who is a rather dilapidated fire engine, awakes to the alarm and races to the scene. As Mayday begins to attack the fire, his decaying hose begins to leak and he runs out of water. As the fire rages, Mayday, Dusty, Chug and Skipper pull down the water tower, causing it to spill water and extinguish the flames.The next day Transportation Management Safety Team or TMST specialist Ryker (a spin off of the real world National Transportation Safety Board or NTSB) interviews Mayday. Expressing extreme disdain to the airports emergency capabilities and outdated firefighting equipment, Propwash Junction is shut down until they find another firefighter to staff the airport and Mayday is upgraded. The residents are outraged, as the towns Corn Fest is coming up quickly. Dusty meets Mayday at the fire house and while looking at his ego wall of awards, notices a photo of him alongside an aerial firefighting plane, which peaks Dusty's interest. Duty agrees to become a firefighter to help reopen Propwash Junction.The next day Chug, Mayday, Dottie and Skipper meet outside of town (with the airport shut down) as Dusty prepares to depart to Piston Peak National Park, home of the Air Attack team. Mayday gives instructions to meet up with Chief Blade Ranger, who Mayday has arranged to train and certify Dusty. He departs on section of highway and makes his way to the park, passing motorist and other aircraft on the way to the park, which just happens to be having a grand re-opening of a new park lodge (cleverly named The Fuselage). Dusty finally makes his way to the air attack base station. Upon landing, he finds several aircraft and vehicles at the base, including a few all terrain vehicles jumping off a dirt ramp, narrowly avoiding hitting Dusty. Leading the group is Dynamite, who welcomes Dusty to the base, introducing her team of Smoke Jumpers to him. Dusty introduces himself, catching the attention of Dipper, an outgoing Bombardier CL-415 SuperScooper, who is an avid air racing fan with a crush on Dusty. She races over and introduces herself and begins flirting with Dusty, who is obviously uncomfortable. Windlifter, a Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane (heavy duty helicopter) shows off his Native American spirit with tales of folklore, even hinting to detecting forest fires before they are detected, foreshadows a fire. Almost immediately, the alarm sounds for a wildfire. The Smoke Jumpers get ready, as Maru, an old tug who's the local mechanic, begins to fill the planes w/ water. The Smoke Jumpers put on their parachutes and load up into Cabbie (shown as a Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar). As the team departs, Dusty becomes curious and follows the team to the reported fire.The team arrives the forest fire, while Dusty stays a bit further back to stay out of the way. Dusty spots Blade Ranger fly through the smoke (shown as a Agusta Westland AW139). Blade Ranger drops his load of fire retardant and issues orders to his team on where to place the retardant. The Smoke Jumpers deploy out of Cabbie, into a field not too far away from the fire. While the aircraft continue to drop the retardant, the Smoke Jumpers use their powerful tools and begin to clear trees and debris to prevent the fire from spreading. From above, Blade Ranger see's a tractor stuck and surrounded by flames. Using his winch and hook, he safely rescues the tractor and moves him to safety. Dusty, amazed by what's happening, accidentally cuts off Blade Ranger. As Dusty attempts to fly away, he accidentally flies into the fire retardant, staining him bright red. Back at the air attack base, Maru washes down Dusty and returns to work, preparing a new batch of retardant for the next fire. Blade Ranger scorns Dusty for flying too close, and orders him back to the lodge. Dusty protests, saying he's the new recruit (Single Engine Air Tanker, or SEAT). Blade appears annoyed, and unimpressed with Dusty's world championship. Blade orders Maru to replace Dusty's landing gear with pontoons. Dusty is impressed with the new look, and after struggling on land, he realizes to deploy the wheels, which make it much easier to move around. As Dusty gets used to his new set of wheels, he notices a wall of fame, and asks how to get on the wall. Maru explains it's a memorial wall, dedicated to all of the fallen firefighters who crashed. Dusty looks at the lost planes while Maru explains how firefighting is dangerous and how it takes a special plane to do what Dusty is doing.Dusty and Blade Ranger begin training by flying low in a canyon, which Dusty accepts in a cocky manor. Blade makes a remark that overconfidence is behavior that can kill, as Dusty begins the course set by Blade. Dusty navigates the canyon walls with ease, and approaches a bridge with a steep climb to clear a waterfall. As Dusty begins to approach the bridge, he begins to push his throttle, and his throttle alarm begins to sound. Realizing he's going too slow and can't add power, he aborts the maneuver, much to Blade's disappointment. They move to the lake to practice filling up the water tank from the lake (using the pontoon floats to scoop water), which Dusty bounces down the lake, narrowly avoiding hitting trees. The two continue training in the classroom, which Blade explains that aircraft are prohibited flying 30 minutes after sunset, in fear of crashing while flying low. Blade sets a few barrels on fire on the runway, while Dusty makes a few passes in attempt to extinguish the flames, failing all passes. The next day, the two are back at the canyon, approaching the bridge. Blade orders Dusty to go to maximum power to clear the steep climb. Dusty's alarm sounds and he aborts the maneuver again. Blade, annoyed, explains that he won't certify Dusty until he can clear the bridge. As they are flying back, Dusty spots a small fire straight ahead. He eagerly flies and drops the fire retardant, only to realize he accidentally dropped his load on a couple of RV's enjoying a campfire. Blade sarcastically congratulates him from \"\"saving them from a nice vacation\"\".Back at the base",Skipper radios Dusty with good news,explaining that they found a replacement gearbox from an old friend,and it's on the way to Propwash Junction. Dusty becomes elated with joy and can't wait to return home. Mayday and Dottie are also on the line

The emperor visits Professor Gustave Franklin's lab to gauge his progress. Franklin has a couple of creatures in a murky test chamber; he calls them Rodrigue (French voice: Benoît Brière; English voice: J.K. Simmons) and Chimène (French voice: Anne Coesens; English voice: Susan Sarandon). (Rodrigue and Chimène are named for characters from legends based on the life of the Spanish hero El Cid -- comparable to Romeo and Juliet.) We can't see the test subjects, but we hear them say a few words. When Franklin reports that he hasn't yet identified the right formula for the ultimate serum, the emperor loses his temper and orders his henchman to shoot Rodrigue and Chimène, without waiting to hear what Franklin urgently wants to tell him. The movie's timeline diverges from our own when the test subjects escape -- we never get a good look at them, but they seem to be four-legged and low to the ground -- and the ensuing explosion kills Franklin and Napoleon III.The immediate result is positive: Napoleon IV signs a peace treaty that averts the Franco-Prussian War, which didn't go well for France and is generally considered to have set the stage for World War I. Before long, though, scientists and inventors start to disappear. Technologies they would have developed -- notably radio, electricity, and petroleum-powered internal combustion and diesel engines -- never appear. Europe uses up its coal to power its steam engines, then consumes its forests. When the story resumes in 1931, France is planning to invade North America for its trees. The French government requires all remaining scientists to work for the state; their priority is to develop new weapons for the coming North American war.The descendants of Professor Franklin are renegades. His son Prosper (French voice: Jean Rochefort; English voice: Tony Robinow), now an old man who wants his family to call him Pops, has continued the search for the ultimate serum in secret. Prosper's son Paul (French voice: Olivier Gourmet; English voice: Mark Camacho) and Paul's wife Annette (French and English voices: Macha Grenon) are in it with him; even their young daughter April tries to help. When we first see Prosper, he's in a conservatory visiting a tree. When Paul comes to bring him back to work, Prosper says he's drawn to the tree and can't help coming every day.The Franklins are distilling the latest version of the ultimate serum when the gendarmes -- police -- break in on them, lead by Inspector Gaspar Pizoni (French voice: Bouli Lanners; English voice: Paul Giamatti). Annette hides the serum by injecting it into April's snowglobe and the family flees, Prosper in a steam-powered car and April, her parents, and her talking cat Darwin (French voice: Philippe Katerine; English voice: Tony Hale) in a police dirigible. Pops gets away; the rest of the family makes it onto a cable car bound for Germany, but the cops catch up with them before the cable car leaves Paris. The cable car is attacked by a strange dark cloud that strikes the police and April's parents with lightning that seems carefully aimed. April and Darwin escape in a kind of lifeboat just before the cable car explodes. In the aftermath Inspector Pizoni, who survived the explosion with injuries, is demoted to agent for bungling the capture of the Franklins. Paul and Annette are presumed dead, but Pizoni vows to win back his rank by finding Prosper.Ten years later, April (French voice: Marion Cotillard; English voice: Angela Galuppo) and Darwin are living on their own in the head of a huge metal statue of one of the Napoleons. Scientists are still disappearing. April makes her way around Paris stealing things she needs, and is followed by a young man, Julius (French voice: Marc-André Grondin; English voice: Tod Fennell), who is Pizoni's informant. (Pizoni hopes that April will lead them to Prosper.) She doesn't know Julius is following her, but the entrance to the statue is well hidden so he loses track of her. April is still working to perfect the ultimate serum, motivated by the knowledge that her beloved Darwin is dying -- his lungs have been damaged by all the soot in the air, product of decades of burning coal and wood in huge quantities. April reads to him (\"\"Puss in Boots","\"\" another story about a talking cat) while they wait to see whether her latest formula will cure him. It doesn't",so she goes out again to steal ingredients for the next attempt.A fairground seems promising. One of the booths features a magic show that includes some chemical effects. (And,oddly
