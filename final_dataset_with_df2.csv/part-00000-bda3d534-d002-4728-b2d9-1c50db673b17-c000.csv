However, Lermontov discovers the romance between his talented composer and his beautiful protege, and he cruelly dictates that Vicky must give up Julian or the dancing. He is shocked, and hurt when she marries Julian, and leaves the company, but remains convinced that she will return to him.Vicky does miss her dancing, and when she is offered the chance to dance 'The Red Shoes'  show once more, she attempts to resist, but eventually gives in to Lermontov's alternate bullying and coaxing. Julian is in London, preparing for the premiere of his new work 'Cupid and Psyche', and discovers that his wife has been coaxed back into dancing with the Lermontov Ballet.

Lermontov takes this as victory and gloats, causing Julian to leave, telling her he is not coming back. Lermontov comforts her a little, promising  ''...And from now onwards, you will dance! Like never before!''  He then leaves to introduce the show.Vicky, completely distraught, commits suicide by throwing herself off a balcony in front of the train that Julian was about to catch.

The costumes are rich and ornate, and Polonaises, the music of Poland, play in the background throughout. Prince Andrei Kurbsky (Mikhail Nazvanov), formerly a best friend to Ivan, enters to hand his sword to the King, who receives it, then returns it, symbolizing a new vassal to lord relationship. Some of Kurbsky's formerly Russian lands are thus passed to Polish control. The courtiers in attendance are all smiles and welcoming faces. Many good looking ladies are sizing up Kurbsky. The ladies use their eyes to show interest either in the man or in the words he says.The happy atmosphere is interrupted by a disheveled courier who arrives and breathlessly announces that Ivan has returned to Moscow as Tsar. At this news, the party is over, and all present quickly leave the throne room.Ivan (Nikolai Cherkasov), back in Moscow as Tsar, looks older and more tired, and there is even a glint of madness and fear in his eyes. Stung at having had one boyar, namely Kurbsky, defect and put Russian land in foreign hands, he wants a new system where the land is always part of Russia and the boyars are caretaker managers of their districts with no power to transfer the land to outsiders. Since this increases his power at the expense of the hereditary landowners, the boyars, they unite in opposition to his plans, and he is alone and friendless.When he laments that he has no one to trust, the only he could trust was his wife and companion, now dead, the chief of his landless supporters, Czar's Guard Aleksei Basmanov (Amvrosi Buchma) tells Ivan that he is a true friend who can be trusted. Ivan immediately scolds him, telling him he cannot be a friend, since he is a hired servant.Basmanov and the Oprichniki help Ivan consolidate his power over the boyars with terror, arranging for the elimination of some of them.Needing friendship, and wanting to have somebody around to trust, he brings to court his old friend Kolychev, who has become Philip the monk, and makes him metropolitan bishop of Moscow. Philip is not willing to help Ivan in any way, insisting that the Tsars role must be to guarantee that old traditional ways of doing things will be maintained. Ivan is so sad and obsessed to have company that he even begs Philip on his knees to remain his friend.Philip agrees, but his intent is to try to bend Ivan to the will of the Church, and exacts a promise that he will have the right to intercede for anyone condemned to death. Philip is frustrated by what he sees as Ivan's misuse of power, as he takes his cues from the boyars.Meantime, Ivan has become used to using executions to consolidate his political power, killing not only those who openly defy, plot or disobey, but even people that he guesses might resent one of his upcoming decisions, such as the person Philip replaces in Moscow.Ivan faces down Philip and lets loose his private force, the Oprichniks, on the boyars. Although as Tsar he must keep his word, he circumvents his promise to Philip by executing those condemned so quickly that they are dead before Philip has even the news that might lead to a plea for intercession. In this way he has three boyars executed. About this time his nickname the Terrible begins to be used.As a sort of explanation of Ivan's relentless will to crush the Boyars, we see a flashback to Ivan's childhood. His mother was poisoned by boyars, and her last words to him were \"\"Don't trust the boyars.\"\" Although young Ivan (Erik Pyryev) is given to wear the trappings of authority in Muscovy",decisions are made by a couple of old boyars who mock him when he asks questions.

Hawthorne approaches Jim Wormold (Alec Guinness), an expatriate Englishman living in Havana in the late 1950s with his beautiful teenage daughter Milly (Jo Morrow), who is attending a Catholic all girls school. Jim has lived in Cuba for fifteen years, and despite the rocky political climate, considers it home. Wormold's spare time consists of drinks with German Dr. Hasselbacher (Burl Ives) and fawning over his daughter, who has reached that precarious threshold between childhood and adulthood.Milly is being trailed by police captain Segura (Ernie Kovacs), who is friendly with the nuns at Millys school, and is looking for a traditional and pretty young woman to be his wife from among the graduating students. Milly, a dazzling blonde, is his target. When the very conspicuous Hawthorne shows up, Segura guesses that something of interest to the police may be going on, and makes inquiries hoping to use the information for blackmailing Jim in his favor, if necessary.Jim owns a vacuum cleaner shop but isn't successful enough, as he wants to provide greater luxuries for Milly, such as finishing school in Switzerland, and Milly has some expensive expectations of her own, such as owning a horse.Jim says yes to Hawthorne because of his money needs, but he has no clue about spying. Hawthorne shows him how to encode messages for telegraphing his reports and gives him general pointers. Hawthorne just tells him to approach people he knows, but that gets Jim nowhere.

When he approaches members of the country club, his social ineptitude creates confusions and they think he is trying to come onto them. Instead of spying, Wormold spends most of his time drinking at the country club, which he can finally afford.Jims closest friend, a former German army officer, Dr. Hasselbacher, suggests that the best secrets are known to no one, so Jim decides to pretend to have a list of agents and provide fictional tales for the benefit of the bosses in London.

Lonely Are the Brave,1962,107,Drama,7.6,David Miller,Dalton Trumbo,Walter Matthau,Michael Kane,Karl Swenson,Martin Garralaga,"The movie opens with modern day cowboy Jack Burns (Kirk Douglas) stretched out beside a dying campfire at dawn, awakened by the roar of fighter jets above the vast, open scrublands of New Mexico. Burns is a cowboy ill at ease with the modern world of the early 1960s. He rolls his own smokes and cuts through fences when they block his path. He carries no ID, not even the requisite draft card. He is on a collision course with the world around him. His only constant companionship comes from Whiskey, his spirited and beloved buckskin mare.Burns rides into Duke City, New Mexico, crossing a busy highway atop his spooked horse and nearly getting killed in the process. He surprises Jerry Bondi (Gena Rowlands), the wife of his best friend, in her kitchen. Her husband Paul (Michael Kane) is in jail, having been sentenced to two years in prison for helping Mexican immigrants cross into the United States illegally. Burns wants to go see him, but Jerry explains that the next visiting opportunity is several days off. Burns divulges that he has been forced to herd sheep just to earn a living. He says he started for Duke City as soon as he learned of Paul's plight.Meanwhile, a long-distance truck driver (Carroll O'Connor) exits a diner in Joplin, Missouri and climbs into the cab of his vehicle, headed for Duke City. He is hauling a load of porcelain toilets in his tractor-trailer.Burns plans to go into town, get drunk, and somehow get thrown in jail in order to see his friend. He finds a Mexican bar and heads for a back table with his beer and a whiskey chaser. On the way to his table, he trips over the intentionally outstretched foot of a one-armed man (Bill Raisch). Burns starts to complain, then notices the man's missing arm and apologizes. Burns sits down, drains a glass of whiskey, and starts nursing his beer, but the one-armed man suddenly throws a whiskey bottle across the room, smashing it against Burns' table. Burns calmly tells the man to watch himself and returns to his beer. The man then throws his whiskey glass at Burns. Burns once again tries to avoid a confrontation, but the man gets up from his table and approaches threateningly. He obviously has a chip on his shoulder about his missing arm, daring Burns to fight him. He kicks the chair out from under Burns, dumping him onto the floor. Amazingly, Burns still tries to avoid a fight, offering the truculent man a drink. The man calls Burns a coward, provoking Burns to slap him. Burns offers to even things up by putting one arm behind his back, and a savage fight ensues. The one-armed man is more than a match for Burns, using his good arm, the stump of his missing arm, a chair, a billiard ball, and a cue stick to attack Burns. A wild melee erupts before the police arrive. Burns is taken to the police station, only to discover that the cells are overloaded and he is therefore being released. When he realizes he won't get to see Paul, he intentionally slugs a cop, earning a lengthy stay in jail.Sheriff Morey Johnson (Walter Matthau) arrives at the police station, where he is greeted by his deputy (William Schallert). Discipline at the police station and jail is noticeably lax, but another sadistic deputy named Gutierrez (George Kennedy) enjoys riding roughshod over the prisoners. Burns quickly earns the hatred of Gutierrez. Burns confides in Paul that he intends to spring him from the jail, but Paul says he doesn't intend to escape and incur a stiffer sentence. Burns then reveals that he has smuggled two hacksaw blades into the jail. He and his Navajo cellmates spend the night sawing through one of the bars before Gutierrez shows up and calls Burns out of the cell. Gutierrez brutally beats Burns before bringing him back. Burns hurriedly resumes his escape efforts before daylight can arrive.As Burns slithers through the opening in the bars, Paul once again declines to escape. Burns is disappointed but understands the difference in their situations. Paul has a wife and child to think of; Burns is all alone. Burns climbs down the side of the jailhouse with the aid of a rope and returns to Jerry's house. Jerry packs him some food before he gathers up spare ammunition and puts a saddle on Whiskey. It is now revealed that Burns and Jerry were once in love before Jack selflessly backed away in favor of Paul. Burns kisses Jerry goodbye and rides off, certain that his pursuers won't be far behind.Sheriff Johnson soon learns that escapee Jack Burns served in the army during the Korean War, earning a Purple Heart and the DSC, along with jail time for striking an officer. Up in the foothills, Burns watches over his shoulder for activity down below and heads for a distant mountain ridge that promises safety. The route gets steeper and more difficult with every switchback. Burns spots several armed deputies in pursuit far below. He is forced to dismount and lead Whiskey up the slippery and treacherous mountain face. Sheriff Johnson now deploys a helicopter to locate Burns. The skittish horse causes Burns considerable delay, allowing the helicopter crew to spot him. Burns expertly puts a rifle round through the tail rotor, causing the helicopter to spiral down and crash.Deputy Gutierrez eventually comes across the tethered horse and thinks he has gotten the drop on Burns, but he soon feels a rifle barrel pressed up against his face. Burns repays his earlier vicious beating with a rifle butt across the face of the sadistic deputy, knocking him out cold. Burns now leads Whiskey up an incredibly steep talus slope, nearly plunging down the mountainside. They are rapidly approaching the summit and freedom, but the deputies are closing in. Just as the deputies are able to get a clean shot at him, Burns reaches the crest and quickly mounts up, spurring his horse downhill into a thick stand of timber and complete concealment. Somehow they have made it. Burns painfully discovers that a bullet has passed through his boot and into his lower leg. He gingerly slides off the horse and fashions a splint from the rifle stock. Mounted up again, Burns rides down to the edge of an interstate highway as a heavy downpour begins. Across the highway is Manzano Mountain and the freedom of Mexico.Barreling down the rain-slick highway is the tractor-trailer introduced earlier, carrying the load of toilets. Burns desperately tries to maintain control over his nervous horse and coax him across the highway through the heavy traffic. At the critical moment, Whiskey spooks and rears up in the middle of the highway. The truck driver cannot possibly stop in time, slamming into man and horse and hurling them onto the shoulder. As a crowd gathers and surrounds the critically injured Jack Burns, Whiskey screams in agony. Burns is in obvious shock, but every scream from the horse is registered on his contorted face. Sheriff Johnson and a deputy soon arrive at the accident scene. Johnson sends the deputy to dispatch the mortally injured horse, and the resulting gunshot causes Burns to wince noticeably. Sheriff Johnson is asked to identify Burns as the escaped fugitive, but the sheriff declines. Burns is loaded onto an ambulance as his cowboy hat washes across the rainy highway.","tragedy, violence",train,imdb

As he speaks to the men about to embark on their first great adventure, his manner runs the gamut from stern, to jovial, amused, profane and reverent.

He has come to give Wint and Kidd a small load of them. When Kidd begins moaning in pain, he claims he has a toothache. The doctor begins to examine him when Wint drops the live scorpion into his shirt, killing him. A helicopter arrives, the pilot demanding to know where the doctor is.

Bond tells Leiter to ship the real diamonds while he relaxes at a Las Vegas hotel and casino called The Whyte House, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Then Bond discovers Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd in his dressing room, who did not know that the diamonds were fake. When the casino pit boss, Mr. Saxby, and the underboss to Wint and Kidd, realizes that Tree did not have the real diamonds, he contacts his superior for further instructions.Later in the casino, Bond meets an opportunistic woman named Plenty O' Toole (Lana Wood). She cheers him on as he gambles, and, (in a deleted scene), they have dinner together. She invites herself up to his room, but after Bond undresses Plenty she is quickly thrown out of a window, landing in the hotel pool by the Slumber Inc. smugglers already waiting in his room, who have now come for the real diamonds.

At the circus, Tiffany picks up the diamonds in a stuffed toy bear doll, unaware that she is under the surveillance of Felix Leiter and his men, but she reneges her deal with Bond and flees, shipping off the diamonds to the next smuggler. When Tiffany returns to her operation residence she finds Bond waiting for her and finds the body of Plenty, who was killed (presumably by Wint and Kidd) when she was mistaken for Tiffany. Having survived the attempt on her life, the initially reticent Tiffany tells Bond where the diamonds are.Bond and Tiffany go to the Las Vegas airport to watch the small locker where Tiffany was instructed to leave the doll containing the diamonds. The doll is picked up by a porter who takes it to the casino pit boss, Saxby, who then drives it in a van to a local filling station where he switches drivers with another who gets in the van. Tiffany distracts the other driver of the van long enough for Bond to sneak in to follow the location of the diamonds. The van is driven outside of the city to a government laboratory in the desert.Posing as a lab worker, Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds a research laboratory owned by reclusive Las Vegas millionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), where he finds the driver of the van is laser refraction specialist Professor Dr. Metz (Joseph Fürst) constructing a satellite. When his cover is blown, Bond escapes from the lab by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. They return to the Vegas that evening where they get into another wild car chase with the local police on Vegas' famous Freemont Street and evade all the police cars.Bond and Case check into a suite in the Whyte House where Felix and his men place Tiffany under house arrest after Bond finally reveals his real identity to her. Bond later scales the walls to the top floor of the Whyte House to confront Willard Whyte. Inside, 007 is confronted by two identical Blofelds who are posing as Whyte using an adapted telephone to mask their voice. (The Blofeld Bond killed in the pre-title teaser was a look-alike.) Not knowing which to kill, Bond kicks Blofeld's white Persian cat into the arms of one of the pair and shoots him. However, Bond again chose the wrong man, killing another look-alike.Bond is rendered unconscious and then inside a pipeline by Wint and Kidd to be trapped underground in the desert. He escapes and contacts Blofeld, posing as one of Whyte's employees and Blofeld's right-hand man, Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and, after a brief battle with his female bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, rescues him, but in the meantime Blofeld escapes from the Whyte House and abducts Tiffany. With the help of Whyte and Felix, Bond returns to the government lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a laser satellite using the diamonds, which is now already in orbit. Blofeld destroys nuclear installations in the United States, Russia, and China, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.Bond identifies an oil rig off the coast of Baja California as Blofeld's base of operations. Arriving at the rig, he is immediately apprehended. Bond plans to switch the cassette containing the codes which control the satellite with a music tape. After he does, he gives the coded one to Tiffany who is living there as a hostage. However, trying to be helpful, she re-switches the tapes, then gets caught trying to fix her mistake and is sent down to the brig. At this point, Felix Leiter and the CIA have already begun a heavy attack on the oil-rig. Tiffany manages to escape amidst the chaos and regroup with Bond. Blofeld tries to escape on a mini-sub, but Bond gains control of it, and crashes the sub into the control room, defeating Blofeld and destroying the satellite control along with the rest of the base.Bond and Tiffany then head for home on a P&O ship Canberra, but they are unaware that Wint and Kidd also aboard. That evening, disguised as waiters, Wint and Kidd enter Bond and Tiffany's stateroom to serve them dinner and to kill them with a bomb hidden in a cake timed to go off in three minutes. Despite having never seen them face to face, Bond sees through their ploy when he recognizes the scent of Wint's aftershave after smelling it earlier in the desert. When Bond blows Wint's cover by tricking him into revealing his poor knowledge of wines, a fight breaks out, and Bond disposes of both of them overboard; Kidd is set on fire and Wint has the bomb tied to him after Bond discovers it. The film ends with Tiffany asking Bond how can they get all the diamonds in the orbiting laser satellite back down to Earth again which now appears as a bright spot in the night sky.","cult, revenge, murder",train,imdb

Flashbacks which appear throughout the movie hint that he has either lost everything he has ever wanted and was reduced to taking the job of a car delivery driver as a last resort, or he is (what is called today) an adrenaline junkie. He is a Medal of Honor winning Vietnam veteran, a former law enforcement officer, former race car driver, and former motorcycle racer. He lost his job as a cop apparently after being framed in a drug bust, perhaps in retaliation for preventing his partner from raping a young girl. He seemingly gave up his automobile and motorcycle racing careers after two near-fatal accidents. He flashes back to a girlfriend, first in a snow-covered landscape, then at the California shore. Vera offers Kowalski marijuana, and comments on his war wound. Vera appears to be Kowalski's great love, and her death while surfing appears to be a major factor in Kowalski's alienation and resignation to death in the film.As the movie opens, Kowalski is near the end of his chase by the California Highway Patrol, where two bulldozers and a CBS News truck are setting up. After seeing the bulldozers, he turns around, only to run into three patrol cars further up the road.

He stops at a biker bar to buy some Benzedrine pills and tells his dealer Jake (Lee Weaver) that he must get to San Francisco by 3 o'clock the next day (although the delivery is not due until Monday). They make a small bet (the cost of the speed), and Kowalski takes off at high speed out of Denver.Later Saturday morning near Glenwood Springs, Colorado, two motorcycle cops appear in Kowalski's rear view mirror and try to get him to pull over for speeding. He runs one off the road and, after stopping and seeing that the officer is unhurt, Kowalski takes off again and shakes the other officer by jumping across a trench. Kowalski is chased across the states of Colorado, Utah, and Nevada and into California, with the police unable to catch him. The whole way, Kowalski has his radio tuned to the station KOW, which is broadcasting out of Goldfield, Nevada. A blind African-American DJ at KOW known as Super Soul listens to the police radio frequency and encourages Kowalski to evade the police.

Bitterly disappointed, Florya walks into the forest weeping and meets Glasha, and the two bond before the camp is suddenly attacked by German paratroopers and dive bombers. Florya is partially deafened from explosions before the two hide in the forest to avoid the German soldiers. Florya and Glasha travel to his village, only to find his home deserted and covered in flies. Denying that his family is dead, Florya believes that they are hiding on a nearby island across a bog. As they leave the village, Glasha sees a pile of bodies behind the house, but does not alert Florya. The two become hysterical after wading through the bog, where Glasha screams at Florya his family were dead in the village. They are soon met by Roubej, a partisan fighter, who takes them to a large group of villagers who have fled the Germans. Florya sees an elderly villager badly burnt by the Germans, who tells him that he witnessed his family's execution. Florya accepts that his family is dead and blames himself for the tragedy.","","",""

Grave Secrets,1989,90,Horror,4.6,Donald P.

Just as another car passes, her father Kurt Norwood (Bob Heron) awakens in the passenger seat and attacks her violently. She screams and struggles to free herself from him. Suddenly an oncoming car almost collides with them, with Iris falling out on the road. Kurt is left to steer the speeding vehicle which crashes into a tree.[TODAY] David Shaw (Paul Le Mat) is sleeping in his office chair. He is very haggard-looking as if he has been through a lot. Darla (Olivia Barash) enters and informs him she has finished her exam. She is obviously interested in the professor, asking him to come to her place. David, seeing the time, exclaims that he is late. He gathers his things and leaves.David is conducting a class on the paranormal and showing slides. One of them pictures Dr. Carl Farnsworth (David Warner), a pioneer in paranormal research who was investigating the ghost of a suicidal bride who jumped Carls body and acted out what happened to her. They learned that she had been brutally raped, murdered and made to look like a suicide. Once her story was told in a séance before witnesses she was able to rest in peace. David calls for the lights, and Iris, who was sitting in on the class, gets up to leave. As the class ends, David goes out into the hall to see Iris walking away. Darla approaches him, giving him an envelope. The letter says that his grant has been not approved due to lack of evidence. Darla sympathizes with him but David takes off.Entering Dean Andrews (Gilbert Lewis) office, David asks why he cant get any funding. Andrews tells him to sit down. David reminds the Dean that he has been teaching for ten years, has a good rapport with his students and has submitted many research papers over the years. Pulling them out of a drawer, Andrews recites the titles of each. All of them focus on one woman, Joanna Shaw, who was Davids wife who died three years earlier. He is told to get over his wife and move on.Back in his office, Iris knocks and enters, telling him she doesnt believe ghosts are innocent. They go to a restaurant for coffee. She shows him a brochure of Homestead House, an old house she is trying to run as a bed and breakfast. She tells him of strange noises at night and loud footsteps outside her door. He asks if anyone else witnessed these. She answers no. He suggests that maybe she is making something up and wants him to prove it so she can get business as a haunted house bed and breakfast. She wants to know why he is so cynical. Telling him it is very difficult for her to ask for his help, she hands him a check made out to him for $5000. He looks it over carefully and agrees, asking for the truth. The first question he asks is: does she know the previous occupants of the house? She says no. Second question: have the attacks been increasing in number and intensity? He notices her hand becoming shaky as she holds the coffee cup. She says yes. Third: how do you feel during the attacks? She says threatened. Her hands become very shaky. Fourth: do you know who the ghost is? At this point she crumples the Styrofoam cup and spills the coffee. He rises and says he will get some napkins. She says no, she will do it herself. Going over to the counter, she looks back and sees David getting napkins from another table. When he returns, she is gone. He looks around to see her going out the door. He goes home, turns on the television and looks at the brochure.The next day David is driving and shaving. He stops at Homers Café and Store. Inside, he finds no one in the store, ringing the service bell. Looking around, he goes through a door into the bar, where Zack is seen throwing darts at a board just a few inches from Davids head. Several other men are seen seated. He tries to ask about the inn, but no one pays him attention. Finally he approaches the bartender Homer (John Crawford) and asks for a bed and breakfast. He is told Homers place has rooms for rent. David insists he wants Homestead House. Homer tells him he doesnt want to stay at  that womans house  because she is not hospitable. Told he is not looking for hospitality, Homer tells David the woman is about as hospitable as a whore on judgment day.Later David arrives at Homestead House and finds no one home. Entering, he calls out and begins looking around. In one room he finds an open book with the pages fluttering from a draft coming from an open window. Returning to the front hall, he finds a hotel register and looks at some of the guests. He goes upstairs, still calling out. He goes from room to room, finding one that looks lived in. An open window blows a book onto the floor from a messy desk. On the desk he sees newspaper ads circled for psychics and a camisole which he picks up. Suddenly Iris enters and demands to know what he is doing. He stares at her. She tells him to leave.Outside, David starts to leave as Iris digs a hole near the front of the yard. He tries to start over with her, but she tells him to go. He says it is late and he is hungry. He wont be able to drive back to town and wants to stay. She agrees to one night.In his room David calls Darlas answering machine and leaves a message, telling her to research former owners for Homestead House and send it care of Homers Spa. Looking out the window he sees Zack, who is arguing with Iris. She tells him to leave.In the kitchen Iris has been cutting veggies and is cleaning a meat cleaver. David enters and tries to call a truce. She points out the water continues to run. David says he thinks it is the water pump and volunteers to help. She tells him instead to chop some wood outside.As David prepares to split a piece of wood with an ax, he notices the wind blowing suddenly. He continues working.At dinner David complements her on the food as she pours him a glass of wine. She gets up to open another bottle of wine, telling him he is eating deer meat. He shows a slight repulsion. While she is turned away, he pours the wine into a nearby plant. When she returns with the bottle, she refills his glass, setting the bottle down. He picks it up and fills her glass. Holding the bottle, he indicates that he will reach over to the side to do something and turns away. She takes this opportunity to pour the wine into the plant. Seeing that he has already done this, she looks sheepishly at him. He is now looking at her with a knowing look, having done that to see if she would pour out the wine herself.She asks him to play a game and he agrees. Each must bounce a coin on the table, trying to land in an empty glass. If he fails, he must take a drink of beer. He tells her that instead of her drinking beer, she must answer a question truthfully. She bounces a coin into the glass and he asks how she afforded the house. She tells him she saved money from her real estate job in the city. He is unable to bounce the coin into the glass, so he takes a drink.We see the clock advance two hours. Now the glass of beer is half-full and David is slightly tipsy. He manages to bounce the coin into the glass and Iris asks why he is not married. He confesses that his wife committed suicide after having a stillborn child. He tells her he is very tired and wants to go to bed. She helps him to his bed where he is sound asleep. She leaves the room, closing the door.Later David awakes and hears digging. He looks out the window and sees Iris digging in the front yard again in the middle of the night. He lies back down and goes to sleep.The next morning David gets coffee in the kitchen. He adds milk to it from the refrigerator. As he is drinking, he suddenly notices an egg broken on the floor. He opens the fridge to see if it fell out but finds no eggs inside. There are a dozen or so eggs in a basket on the table. As he turns away again, he hears another egg drop. He looks puzzledly at the two broken eggs on the floor. Then his eyes catch sight of an egg being lifted from the basket. Floating in midair, the egg is hurled and breaks on Davids face.Next we see David setting up his computer and equipment in the house to investigate. He takes measurements of the positions of the eggs and charts the information. As he is doing so, Iris enters and stands over him. She tells him she doesnt want to communicate with the spirit. He says we must or it wont leave them alone. Suddenly a cry is heard from outside. They go out front and see an ax thrown which lands in the porch column. He takes Iris inside. From the trees and bushes we see Zack approaching, laughing.Later we see David writing and making notes. We hear his voice telling us what he is writing. Iris looks at him and asks what he is thinking. He wonders what she is doing in this place by herself. She says she is supposed to have guests. He tells her they leave in a day or two. She says she felt safe when she first moved there, before the troubles began. At this point we see a phonograph record floating in the air, which is noticed by David. The record is removed from its sleeve and placed on a turntable and played.  Fur Elise  by Beethoven plays. Iris looks around and notices the clock says midnight. She tells him the sequence has begun. David activates the cameras to tape from a remote. They observe a book being lifted and carried over to David, who takes it. At this point heavy breathing is heard. David is seen choking, telling her a man is doing it. She rises to help him and a loud scream is heard. Davids throat is released and he says he thinks he is in the mans chair. The book falls to the floor. The house begins to shake and the needle skips on the record. Then the fire goes out and the lights also. Grabbing a flashlight, David hears heavy footsteps on the stairs. They go up and the footsteps stop. Next the flashlight goes dead. David looks into a room but sees nothing. He approaches her on the steps and stands against the wall. She asks what he is doing, and he suggests the spirit might be making contact. He calls to the man, who opens and closes a door and pushes between them, walking away. As David follows downstairs, he observes the front door open and close, as if the man has walked out.David looks at the computer screen to play back what was captured. He shows Iris the figure of a headless man walking downstairs. He asks who it is, but she doesnt remember. She insists on going outside but he prevents her, telling her it is more important to allow him to hypnotize her so she can remember who it is.He hypnotizes her with a swinging watch. When he asks her who the attacker is, she refuses to say, citing too much pain. He tells her to open her eyes and look at the pain. At this point she relives the rape and he is forced to bring her out of the trance.Back at Homers place David asks for an envelope from the mail. He finds Homer going through the contents (deeds and ownership records). Homer finally hands him the envelope and tells him its a small community and they all like to know whats going on with everyone. He tells David the original owners of the house were two spinster sisters who died there. He blames Iris for the troubles that came a year after she moved in. He tells David the man found in the car which crashed into the tree (the same car Zack saw in Iriss driveway ten minutes earlier) could not be identified because the head was missing (which presumably fell into the river). Homer jokingly warns David he could be next. When David asks for a plumbers snake to fix the water pump, he gets no response from Homer. Turning to leave, David is struck in the face by the door, opened by Zack (who utters  whoops ).Back at the house Iris is dressing Davids wound in the bathroom when a prescription vial falls out of the medicine chest. He picks it up, noticing it is for Iris from a Dr. Kathleen Thorpe (Ruth Manning). He tells Iris he wants to bring in a trans-medium to contact the spirit. She says no, that she doesnt want anyone to know.  Know what?  he presses. At this point another high-pitched scream is heard and David goes to examine his equipment. He and Iris observe a glowing light coming from the attic.In the attic, David watches as an antique baby buggy rolls around and a stuffed animal floats in the air. A womans nightgown is lifted and torn in half. David places his hand on the source of the light, which goes out.He is seen going through documents from a box found in the attic. There is a record of a child on one of them. Iris faints and we see the bottle of pills in her hand, now empty.Dr. Thorpe comes out of the examining room at the hospital where David is waiting and tells him they had to pump a dozen diazepam (Valium) from her stomach. Recognizing that she treated Iris before, he asks about the Valium prescribed. Dr. Thorpe says it was after the rape. David says he is from the adoption agency and wants to know the name of the father. She says she doesnt know and isnt surprised that Iris wont tell anyone. David gets on the phone to Darla, asking her to find the records on the child put up for adoption and all the details. Zack is seen coming in with flowers for Iris, but after overhearing the conversation on the pay phone, he disgustedly throws the flowers into the trash and leaves.Zack is seen belly-aching to Homer about the guy moving in on his girl (Iris). Homer advises him to fix the water pump, saying it might give him an advantage with her. Taking the advice, he steps up over the bar and retrieves two six-packs of beer, saying he will head out to Iriss house.Later that afternoon at the house, Iris is stoking wood into the fireplace and hears a car pull up. David is studying the imaging equipment on his computer of the headless man. She calls him and they go outside to see Dr. Carl Farnsworth arriving. David tells her that he was already on his way. He introduces himself to Iris. She tells him he came for nothing and that she is not going anywhere. David explains that Iris is staying at home. David hints that Carl needs to stay overnight since it is so late (winking at Carl, who follows his lead). Reluctantly Iris says he can stay for the night and David shows him to his room.Telling Carl they should begin after Iris is asleep so as not to upset her, Carl asks how long he has been interested in her. Meanwhile a drunken Zack is seen working on an exposed pipe near the house and talking as if to Iris. He looks into the end of the pipe to see if he can find what is blocking it.Carl sits down in an easy chair while David fixes drinks. Iris comes in with a tray of coffee, and seeing Carl sitting there, suggests he not sit there. Suddenly there is a knock on the door. David goes to answer it. It is Darla, who enters. She introduces herself to Iris, saying she is Davids personal assistant,  the wild woman behind the man, so to speak.  She introduces herself to Carl while Iris demands to know what is going on. Darla says a fourth person is needed for a séance. David tells Iris they were going to wait until after she was asleep. She sarcastically thanks him. Darla produces a large envelope of documents from the adoption agency, telling them she obtained it by pretending to be Iris. Visibly upset and citing confidentiality, Iris demands they all leave. Carl insists they dont need the papers, saying they will find out directly from the spirit.As the séance begins, Carl tells them to not break the concentration no matter what happens. Iris is seen having drunk a glass of wine. Carl reveals a syringe of Thorazine, telling them to give it to him if the spirit wont let him go. He sips from a glass of water and begins the ceremony, calling to the spirit haunting Iris. After a moment unearthly sounds are heard. He asks David to continue. David repeats the call, after which the clock stops and more sounds are heard. From the fireplace the headless ghost appears and walks around the table, finally settling into Carl. Iris demands they stop. Carl, possessed by the spirit, begins writing on a sheet of paper. David tells Darla to read what it says by holding up a mirror. The backwards writing is then seen:  Iris . Iris gasps as a voice calls her name. David asks what his name is and is told  Kurt  and then the last name  Norwood . David asks if he is the husband of Iris and he laughs. Iris says  no, hes not my husband. Hes nothing to me-disgusting.  She addresses the spirit, demanding to know where  it  is. He replies that she knows because she killed it. David attempts to restrain Iris and the spirit (in Carls body) approaches and hurls David to the side. Darla is called upon to give Carl the shot. She tries but is tossed aside, the syringe falling to the floor. Meanwhile the spirit is choking Iris. David grabs the syringe and gives Carl the shot. He is thrown back again, but this causes the spirit to leave the body of Carl. It walks back into the fireplace and vanishes.David is seen talking to Darla who is in the front seat of an ambulance, asking for extra credit. Paramedics bring out Carl on a stretcher and Iris apologizes to him. He says he never takes it personally. He cautions David to take Iris away but she says she cant leave and runs inside. David asks what to do if he cant get Iris to leave and is told the malevolent spirit will destroy everyone unless he can find the head before Kurt does.Meanwhile Zack, having gotten his hands on the obstruction in the pipe, pulls it out, only to scream as it is revealed to be the missing head.David comes in where Iris is sadly reading documents brought from the adoption agency. He reads from one which states that the child died. Iris says it was not a natural death but that she (stops talking). David replies that she couldnt have killed her own baby. She says that he couldnt know what people would do. Her father came in every night since her mother died and molested her and raped her. She shows him her scars from resisting her fathers advances. He continued to follow her after she left home, finding her more than once. He claimed to have changed and wanted them to be a family again, but there were too many bad memories.Recalling the night the baby was born, Iris is seen in labor. Kurt is seen sitting in his favorite chair, reading his favorite book and listening to his favorite song until the child is born. He comes into the bedroom with the meat cleaver and hacks down by the child. She tells David that in the struggle she rolled over on the baby to protect it but blacked out. When she came to, the baby was gone. She struggled to go outside where her father came up with a shovel, saying he buried it. He told her she had smothered it to death so he didnt have to kill it. She struck him with the shovel and drove with him in the car, going to the sheriffs office. When he came to and began attacking her, she bailed out of the car just before it struck a tree.Zack is seen at his truck but hears a noise and goes to investigate. Meanwhile David tells Iris that the spirit will re-enact the crime as he has every night at midnight. They wait outside the door until the spirit comes out carrying the crying baby. She calls out that the baby is still alive at that point. David shushes her. They follow him down close to Millers Bridge where he is seen burying the baby. She cries out that he buried it alive, but again she is restrained by David. Zack is seen carrying the head wrapped in a cloth.Iris chases after her father and tries to tackle him, but is unable to touch the spirit. David digs at the spot where the child was buried. Meanwhile Zack sees the crashed car and looks inside, seeing no one. As he turns around, the headless spirit is seen. Shocked, Zack drops the head, which immediately begins to re-attach itself to the body. Now appearing as a ghoul, Kurt grabs the head of Zack and twists it off, laughing fiendishly.After digging some more, David shows Iris the body of her son Brian (not shown). Suddenly Kurt appears and attacks David, throwing him aside. He tells Iris that he has come for Brian. She cries no, telling David that he wont stop until he has the remains of the child. Suddenly a light shines from the grave and David and Iris both call upon the innocent spirit of Brian Norwood. A struggle ensues between this light and Kurt, finally resulting in a total explosion of the ghouls body. Iris removes the remains from the grave and wraps them up. David tells her that they will bury him in consecrated ground.Iris is seen laying flowers on the grave of Brian with David. They embrace.That night they are seen in bed together. At midnight, Iris hears something. David tells her that everyone is at peace and that it is just the wind. They lie back to sleep. Iris awakes and takes out a flashlight, looking around. When she looks under the bed, Kurt is seen calling her name. She screams but wakes up from a dream. He reassures her it was just a bad dream. She insists they look under the bed. When they both look, they see nothing. He tells her it is over and they kiss. David looks over at the clock and sees the sequence beginning again at midnight.","paranormal, haunting",train,imdb

Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor,1994,90,Action,4.0,Albert Pyun,Albert Pyun,Thom Mathews,Kamel Krifa,Nicholas Anthony,Brad Thornton,"The camera pans along the outside of Sante Federal Penitentiary and into the cell of David Sloane (Sasha Mitchell). David is writing a letter to his wife, Vicky (Deborah Mansy), talking to her about how he was framed for a crime he didn't commit, at the hands of Tong Po. David begins talking about events that began when his brother Eric, a national kickboxing champion, went to Thailand to fight in bigger challenges. Flashbacks to scenes from the movie Kickboxer show Eric arrogantly believing he can best any challenger until he fights Tong Po (then played by Michel Qissi), who cripples him with a brutal elbow to his spine as he is prone on the mat. David's letter then talks about his other brother, Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) training in Thailand to avenge Eric. Kurt defeated Tong Po and dishonored him. Tong Po ambushed both Kurt and Eric before they could leave Thailand and murdered them. Then, when he found out there was a third Sloan brother, he came to America to force David to fight him. (Scenes from Kickboxer 2: The Road Back highlight these flashbacks). After Tong Po burned down David's gym, killing a young boy, Sloane trained with the same elderly Thai who trained Kurt, and defeated Tong Po. David then met Vicky, and they married and opened a school, and life was good... until David was arrested and jailed. David's letter concludes by warning Vicky that he believes even this will not be enough to sate Tong Po's wrath-- David is sure that Vicky herself will be targeted. He is warning her to hide and run from Tong Po, so that she is safe.A car drives into a gated estate. Two men emerge, dragging along a captive woman wearing handcuffs. She is brought into the estate where one of her captors has her handcuffs removed. Immediately she lashes out against both men, killing one of them. Her attempted flight is halted as Tong Po enters the room. The captive woman is Vicky Sloan. She tries to fight Tong Po (now played by Kamel Krifa), who easily wards off her attack and leaves her crumpled on the floor after a brutal knee to her stomach. Identifying himself to Vicky, Tong Po shoves her down onto a bed and brutally rapes her.Back at the penitentiary, David is told he has mail. He opens the letter and then sits on his chair back in his cell in disgust. The letter says simply, 'Don't worry-- I'm taking good care of her. Your old friend, Tong Po,' along with a photo of Vicky as Tong Po's captive.David fights another inmate in a yard fight, knocking him out. Officers break it up and put him in solitary. Later he is brought into a room to be spoken to by a visitor, who turns out to be a DEA agent named Casey (Nicholas Guest). David receives Casey coldly, and they briefly argue over the events leading up to David's imprisonment before David tells him that it's been two years that Vicky has been held captive by Tong Po... David believes she's probably dead. Casey is offering David a way out: Tong Po has been the most powerful drug lord in Mexico for five years now, operating out of a sprawling ranch-estate that is fortified as well as any fortress. The DEA can't get close enough to shut him down. But every year on the 'Day of the Dead,' Po invites top fighters from around the world to compete at his compound, and the winner is challenged to fight Tong Po himself, for a million dollars. The DEA plans to secrete David as a fighter in the tournament. Some of Tong Po's men are in the pentientiary and the DEA will use David having been in solitary to 'hide' him from them. The mission is dangerous because Tong Po might recognize David, even after so many years since their last encounter. David is cynical at being recruited and offered freedom only because the DEA needs him, but he's more than ready to settle the score with Tong Po once and for all, and free Vicky from captivity.As David walks out of the prison, a biker rides by, dropping a manila envelope. It contains a faked passport for David and instructions to go to a location where back-alley street fights are held. He needs to impress one of Tong Po's men in these fights to get invited to the tournament. David passes a woman doing Tai Chi exercises and has a memory of training Vicky in martial arts.David goes to where the fight is happening. Interrupting the fight, he takes on both participants and knocks them out. Brubaker (Nicholas Anthony) is impressed and gives David the invite to the tournament down in Calixico, Mexico, with a million dollar payday for the big winner. As David walks on, Brubaker makes the call to tell Tong Po's men about a new entrant named Jack Jones, and tells them, 'don't piss him off.'David gets a ride with a biker to a town five miles from the Mexican border. He goes into a rough redneck bar where some of the men are harrassing a short blonde woman named Megan Laurence (Michele Krasnoo). When she proves adept at fending them off, some of them get behind her and break bottles over her head to knock her out. David cleans house, knocking everyone into the middle of the next millennium. But Megan proves entirely ungrateful and cold to David for his assistance. She realizes that David is headed to Mexico for the tournament and gives him a word of advice: that when he meets her in battle, to assume they'd never met.David gets a ride down to Calixico and makes his way to Tong Po's compound. He is met there by the hostess, Darcy (Jill Pierce). She takes him to the area where fighters battle it out to qualify for the tournament. As he is 'registered' for the final qualifying matches, he sees Megan Laurence staring intently at him.David watches a qualifying fight that shows a tall man with a long ponytail and a short goatee named Thomas (Burton Richardson) as a fearsome, sadistic fighter. He is then selected for the next qualifying match, finding to his dismay that his opponent is Megan. David doesn't want to fight Megan, thinking she is in way too far over her head already. Megan rakes a vicious kick across his face that hardly fazes him except for briefly snapping his head to one side. Sighing, David easily dodges her next attack and puts her in a sleeper hold that knocks her out.David is given a guest room on the compound and promptly sneaks out, finding that he has an ally-- Lando Smith (Brad Thornton), the young brother of one of David's students, whose life was straightened out by David.David continues sneaking around, trying to get intel, while Lando tries to question Darcy, whose answers are elusive but show she's not without a heart. Lando finds out that Tong Po will probably make Megan Laurence into one of his sex captives-- and when these young women reach a certain age, their future is grim.The fighters that qualified for the tournament are regaled at an opening celebration. David stares coldly as Tong Po is introduced. Later, David and Lando are talking. Concerned at being recognized by Tong Po, David hopes to discreetly locate Vicky and sneak away with her. Finding the celebration not to his liking, David leaves to return to his room.Tong Po takes the microphone again to announce that he is allowing one of the disqualified fighters a second chance to prove worthy of the tournament. Guards usher Megan Laurence forth and Tong Po announces that any fighter who defeats her will receive a $25,000 bonus-- but if Megan wins that battle, she'll take the place of the fighter who lost to her. A number of fighters all rush at Megan, who fights them off. Lando comes to her defense, even challenging Tong Po himself and not backing down after all the guards aim their guns right at him point blank. Tong Po merely laughs Lando off and tells him to enjoy the rest of the celebration. Megan grudgingly thanks Lando, who leads her away to get her cleaned up. Darcy intently watches them walk away.Darcy later goes to Lando's room to seduce him, and she is stunned when he turns her away. She leaves angrily, suggesting that maybe he 'doesn't like girls' or else 'prefers underage tramps.'After having snuck through much of Tong Po's compound, David takes out some papers from the manila envelope he'd received outside the penitentiary, which include a blueprint of the compound. Later that evening, he again sneaks through the compound in dark clothes and a ski mask. He finds his way to where many women are held captive and forced to have sex with compound men, and with each other. He knocks out two guards and finds Vicky in a cell. But before he can rescue her, security alarms sound and he must elude converging security to make it back undetected to his room.The next morning everyone is gathered in the tournament area. Tong Po warns all the fighters that he knows that someone trespassed into private areas of the compound, and anyone caught doing so would face serious punishment. The competition begins, and a number of matches are shown.Guards bring Vicky breakfast. She tries to melee with them and it takes four of them to grapple and restrain her.More matches are shown. Thomas, Megan and Lando all win their matches. David manages to keep his back and profile to Tong Po throughout his match, and also defeats his opponent.After the first round is over, Lando and David talk. David says he knows where Vicky is being held, and needs to find a way in. Lando says he might know a way. He goes to hit on Darcy, who is still steaming mad over his rebuffing her the previous night. But deep down, she still lusts for Lando, and gives in to his advances. After they are done, Lando confides in Darcy that he's here to free a woman captive who's been in the compound two years. Darcy is afraid of being found out, but Lando plays on her compassion; despite her suggestions to the contrary, Lando knows that Darcy herself is a captive of Tong Po, and he'll probably dispose of her anyway for someone younger once she reaches a certain age. He offers to try and help rescue her as well if she trusts him.As Lando leaves Darcy's room, another man knocks on her door.David leaves Lando's room, thanking him for his help. There's a knock on Lando's door, and two men rush in and knock him out.Lando awakens tied to a chair in Tong Po's home in the compound. Tong Po confronts Lando, knowing he is a DEA agent. Tong Po tries to torture it out of him, rubbing salt into Lando's wounds, but Lando doesn't break. Finally Tong Po plays one last card-- he has Darcy brought in. She is bound and gagged, dirty and disheveled, and it looks like she's been sexually abused. Tong Po takes a small knife blade and makes several deep cuts in Darcy's flesh as she screams in agony through her gag. Lando finally admits to being DEA and Tong Po 'thanks' him by making one last deep stab into Darcy's breast.David goes to where women captives are held and finds the cells empty. He knows that Tong Po is on to him and the women have been moved in anticipation. He fights his way through several converging guards until he is ambushed and knocked out by Tong Po himself. Tong Po unmasks David and promptly recognizes him. Tong Po's torturing of Darcy broke Lando into revealing everything.Early the next morning. David, Lando and Darcy are tied to ceiling beams in a cell. Darcy is dead, hanging limply from the ropes binding her wrists. Lando tells David that he's a DEA agent and infiltrated the tournament as David's backup.The final tournament rounds are scheduled to begin. Tong Po tells the remaining fighters that unlike the previous rounds, these matches are to the death. Each fight ends only with the death of one opponent. Those who are too intimidated by these odds, must leave the compound immediately. But when a few of the contestants choose to take Tong Po up on the offer, he pulls a gun and kills them all.The final matches begin with competitors stepping up their game. Megan refuses to finish off her beaten opponent, and Tong Po laughs at her defiance. Bodies of slain opponents are dragged just to the outside edges of the fighting ring and left there. When only a few participants are left, Lando and David are brought in. Tong Po announces that five years ago, his wife Sian was killed in a fire resulting from a DEA raid. He holds David Sloan responsible for Sian's death. He announces that a half a million dollar bonus will go to whomever fights David. A gunman forces a handcuffed Vicky to her knees on a walkway overlooking the tournament area.Thomas grabs the opportunity to fight David, but David defeats Thomas and two other challengers. Getting frustrated, Tong Po orders Megan to fight David. Getting to her feet, Megan reveals what she now understands about the tournament: it's all a setup for wanton violence. Tong Po never intended to pay anyone or let any of the participants leave alive. She feels that Tong Po is afraid of fighting David himself. She, David, Lando, and the other fighters attack all the guards and take them out, except for Thomas, who fights on Tong Po's side. Lando knocks Thomas out as Tong Po enters the ring himself. He beats Lando savagely, and doesn't even look at Megan as she batters him about the chest and midsection with kicks. He only smiles when she lands several kicks to his face before knocking her off her feet.David and Tong Po lock eyes. David stalks him out into the area where the opening celebration was held. Tong Po holds Vicky in a chokehold. David coldly tells him that killing Vicky will not bring back Tong Po's honor, but only shame him forever. Seething with malice, Tong Po acknowledges the truth of David's words and releases Vicky. David wades into battle with Tong Po, becoming more vicious every minute until he is beating Tong Po nearly within an inch of his life. Tong Po's right hand man finally interrupts the battle by threatening Vicky with a gun. David steps away from Tong Po, who scuttles away like a scalded dog.David stalks toward the right-hand man, discreetly picking up a long knife. Hurling it from behind his back, he kills the right hand man.The remaining fighters make their way out of the compound, Megan helping Lando as they meet up with David and Vicky. The camera pans away from the compound into the skies as we fade to black.","revenge, cult, violence",train,imdb
The Lion King,1994,88,Drama,8.5,Roger Allers,Irene Mecchi,Rowan Atkinson,Robert Guillaume,Matthew Broderick,Nathan Lane,"\"The Lion King takes place in the Pride Lands of Africa, where a lion rules over the other animals as king. As dawn breaks, all the animals of the Pride Lands are summoned to Pride Rock, the home of the pride of lions. Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), a mandrill, walks through the herd and climbs the face of Pride Rock to greet his friend, King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). Mufasa leads Rafiki to his mate Sarabi (Madge Sinclair) who is holding their newborn cub. Rafiki anoints the cub with fruit juices before presenting him to the gathered animals. The animals cheer and then bow to the new future king.Meanwhile, Scar (Jeremy Irons), the younger brother of Mufasa, is sulking by himself behind Pride Rock. He is envious of his brother's position as king and is disgruntled at the fact that he will never be king now that Mufasa has an heir. Mufasa and his majordomo, a hornbill named Zazu (Rowan Atkinson), confront Scar on why he wasn't present at the ceremony that morning. Scar shrugs it off, claiming he had forgotten, and scoffs his new responsibility to show respect to the future king before wandering off.As monsoon storms drench the Pride Lands, Rafiki is seen in his tree home, a large baobab, adding details to his newest piece of wall art. He chuckles lightly as he finishes, reciting the new cub's name, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas).Now a budding youth, Simba rises early one morning and pesters his father to get up and show him the lands he's destined to rule over. Mufasa illustrates from the top of Pride Rock that everything the light touches is their kingdom, except for a place on the horizon that is covered in shadow. Mufasa tells Simba he's forbidden from ever going there. Out in the plains, Mufasa tells Simba that there is a balance to all life which eventually comes full circle; the Circle of Life. When Zazu appears with a morning report, Mufasa takes the opportunity to give Simba a pouncing lesson which goes successfully, much to Zazu's dismay. As Simba gets ready to try again, Zazu suddenly exclaims that a group of hyenas has been seen in the Pride Lands. Mufasa rushes off to deal with it while Zazu takes Simba home.Simba returns to Pride Rock where his Uncle Scar is lurking about. Simba brags about his fate to be king to which Scar reacts without the slightest bit of enthusiasm. Casually, and goading Simba's excitement, Scar asks if Mufasa showed him the shadow place on their morning walk. When Simba replies no, Scar adds that it is a dangerous place where only the bravest lions venture. Simba perks up, saying he's brave, and begs his uncle to tell him what's there. Scar feigns an accidental slip of the tongue by revealing that it's an elephant graveyard but praises Simba's cleverness. He asks that Simba never explore the place, but as Simba reassures him and leaves, Scar smiles to himself knowing full well that Simba's curiosity will get the better of him.Simba meets up with his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) who is being bathed by her mother, Sarafina Zoe Leader. He tells her about a cool place he has found, lying to Sarabi that its around the water hole. Sarabi gives them permission to go as long as Zazu accompanies them. Along the way, Simba and Nala devise a plan together to get rid of Zazu, which works. They then run off, Nala showing off her skills as an expert pinner, before finding themselves in the elephant graveyard. Suddenly, Zazu reappears and demands that they leave. Simba shows off his bravery by laughing in front of a large skull. Laughter echoes from within and three hyenas emerge, surrounding the cubs. Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), Banzai (Cheech Marin), and Ed (Jim Cummings) deliberate what's to be done with the cubs, more specifically, how to eat them. The cubs and Zazu escape for a moment, but Zazu is pulled back and stuffed into a boiler which shoots him into the air. The hyenas eventually corner the cubs in an alcove and Simba tries to roar. The hyenas laugh and tell him to try again. A real roar is let out as Mufasa appears and attacks the hyenas before they run off. Zazu reappears by Mufasas side and Simba tries to say something but Mufasa furiously reprimands him for being deliberately disobedient and leads them towards home.Back in the Pride Lands, Mufasa tells Zazu to take Nala home while he teaches Simba a lesson. Fearful and meek, Simba walks up to his father, noticing that his father's paw print is much bigger than his own. He apologizes for disobeying but says he only wanted to be brave like Mufasa. Mufasa tells Simba he's only brave when he has to be. As they reconcile, Mufasa tells Simba that all the stars in the night sky are the spirits of kings past and that they will always be there to guide him, as will he.Back in the graveyard, the hyenas lick their wounds and quarrel with each other. Their fights are broken up by Scar who is greeted as a friend. Irritated that the hyenas couldnt dispose of the cubs, he proposes a plan that would eliminate both Simba and Mufasa from the throne.The next day, Scar escorts Simba through a gorge and puts him near a rock shaded by a sapling, telling him that Mufasa is planning a surprise for him. Scar instructs Simba to stay put while he fetches Mufasa and suggests that he practice his roar while he's away. Just above the gorge, the three hyenas lie in wait in front of a massive herd of wildebeest. Scar appears above them, signaling them. As Simba waits, scowling over his little roar, a chameleon climbs down from the tree. Simba practices roaring at it, finally letting off one loud enough to scare the chameleon and echo off all sides of the gorge. But the ground starts shaking and Simba looks up to see the herd of wildebeest charging down the gorge straight for him. He runs away, the wildebeest gaining, while Scar warns Mufasa nearby that there is a stampede in the gorge and Simba is down there. Simba manages to grab hold of a broken tree, elevating himself above the wildebeests' horns while Mufasa climbs down and runs alongside the animals. He manages to grab Simba in his mouth and carries him to safety, but is pulled back by the charging animals. After a tense moment, Simba watches his father leap onto the side of the gorge, digging his claws into the dirt and struggling up the hillside. As Mufasa nears the top, he sees Scar standing over him. He pleads for help, but Scar digs his claws into his paws and mocks him before pushing him off. Simba watches helplessly as Mufasa falls onto the stampeding herd.As the dust settles, Simba runs down to look for his father. He discovers him beneath a broken tree, dead. As he mourns his loss, Scar appears and blames Simba for what happened. Simba, thinking he had started the stampede that killed his father, follows his uncles advice when Scar tells him to run away and never return. Simba runs off as Scar instructs his hyenas to kill him. The three hyenas chase Simba to the edge of an incline where he tumbles into a sea of brambles. Small enough to avoid the sharp spikes, Simba runs through them as the hyenas barely manage to stop near the base. Unlucky Banzai is shoved into the brambles and emerges howling, stuck with thorns. The hyenas watch as Simba runs into the distant desert and decide that he will most likely die, shouting to him that if he ever comes back they will kill him.Scar returns to Pride Rock to announce that both Simba and Mufasa have perished in the stampede and assumes the role as king. The lionesses look on in fear as a horde of hyenas arrives to live alongside Scar at Pride Rock. Rafiki watches sullenly from a distance and smears the image he had once created of Simba.In the desert, Simba has collapsed under the heat and a group of vultures descends on him. Suddenly, a meerkat and a warthog charge into them, bucking and kicking them away as part of their favorite game; bowling for buzzards. The warthog, Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), then discovers Simba and brings him to the attention of his meerkat companion, Timon (Nathan Lane). Timon is initially afraid of the young lion but Pumbaa asserts that he's still little and will grow up to be on their side instead of eating them. Timon scoffs at the idea, before suggesting the very same thing as his own. Pumbaa picks Simba up and carries him into the shade where he's revived. Simba thanks them for their help before walking away. Timon and Pumbaa take pity on him and tell him that, whatever happened to him, he has to put his past behind him, citing their motto Hakuna Matata; no worries. They then invite Simba to stay with them as a fellow outcast in their jungle paradise and teach him to eat bugs rather than meat. Simba begins to cheer up and eventually grows into a healthy, carefree adult (Matthew Broderick).Meanwhile, the Pride Lands have been reduced to a wasteland under Scars rule. Zazu is confined to a bone cage singing while Scar lazily lies about chewing on bones. Zazu mutters under his breath that he never had to do this under Mufasa. Scar reels on the name, citing that the law is to never mention Mufasas name. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed appear, complaining that food and water have become scarce and that the lionesses refuse to hunt. Scar suggests they eat Zazu as Banzai lets slip Mufasas name before he corrects himself under Scars glare. Scar then dismisses them.Back in the jungle, Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa lie down together after a meal of bugs to look up at the night sky. Pumbaa asks what the sparkling lights in the sky are to which Timon replies that theyre fireflies that got stuck in the big, bluish-black thing. Pumbaa says he'd always thought they were burning balls of gas billions of miles away, a theory which Timon debunks due to Pumbaa's flatulent nature. They ask Simba what he thinks. Answering only to their begging, he says he was once told that the lights are great kings of the past watching over them. Timon starts cracking up over the thought of royal dead guys watching them, but Simba wanders off, saddened over the memory of his father. He sighs and collapses onto a bunch of wild flowers, spreading their petals and leaves to the wind. The wind carries them back to the Pride Lands where Rafiki, sitting atop his tree, grabs them. He takes them back into the tree where he sniffs them and contemplates the apparent familiar smell. Suddenly it strikes him; Simba must be alive. Crazed with happiness, he quickly smears a mane around the head of his Simba drawing, stating that it is time.Timon and Pumbaa are walking through the jungle together when Pumbaa becomes distracted by a large rhino beetle. Hungry, he follows it to the edge of the jungle and sneaks up on it as its perched on a log facing some grassland. His eye then catches something in the tall grass as the beetle flies away. Pumbaa screams as a lioness emerges from the grasses and gives chase. Hearing Pumbaa, Timon comes running and finds him stuck in the roots of a tree. He tries to free Pumbaa as the lioness draws closer. She leaps forward but Simba jumps in and begins to fight with her while Timon cheers him on. He tries to knock her down but she flips him over and pins him to the ground. Simba recognizes this move and his old friend, Nala (Moira Kelly). When he reveals himself, Nala is shocked and happy to see him again. Simba introduces her to Pumbaa and Timon, who is less than happy about the reunion since Nala had tried to eat Pumbaa. Nala tells Simba that everyone in the Pride Lands thought he was dead after Scar told them about the stampede. Nervous, Simba asks what else Scar told them, but Nala says that it doesn't matter now that he's alive and the rightful king. Simba excuses Timon and Pumbaa to speak to Nala alone. As they walk through the jungle together the romantic settings encourage their feelings for each other, though Simba is hesitant to talk to Nala about his past. She tries to get Simba to go back to the Pride Lands with her, telling him that everything has fallen into disarray since Scar took the throne. He refuses, explaining that he shouldnt worry about things that happened in the past, which angers Nala. She tells Simba that returning to the throne is his responsibility but he storms off and walks out of the jungle to an open field. He tries to justify his decision before yelling at the night sky that Mufasa wasnt there for him and feeling solemn that it was his fault.He then hears singing coming from a tree behind him and sees Rafiki in the branches. Irritated, he walks away. Rafiki follows him and asks him a series of rhetorical questions and chanting seemingly nonsensical words. Convinced that the baboon is crazy and confused, Simba turns to walk away when Rafiki reveals that he knows Simba is Mufasas son. Rafiki then runs off and Simba follows. He finds Rafiki mediating on a rock and asks if he knew his father. Rafiki says \"\"I know your father\"\"",to which Simba responds that he died. Rafiki laughs,saying that Mufasa is alive,and leads Simba through a thicket of trees and vines. They stop at a reflecting pool and Rafiki instructs Simba to look into it.

Later, Obi-Wan privately tells Anakin that the Council wants him to spy on the Chancellor because they believe him to be corrupt, an order Anakin resents since the Chancellor has become a mentor to him. As the Chancellor's bodyguard, Anakin develops a close friendship with Palpatine, who subtly manipulates Anakin in their discussions, making him distrust the Jedi.

That night, his friends throw him a dagger, which he conceals from the soldiers as they file out at dawn on the third day. The Colonel himself attempts to ride Spirit, who, despite his best efforts, cannot throw him and appears to give up, exhausted. The Colonel is very pleased with himself and rides Spirit around the corral, boasting. But Spirit is merely regaining his strength and, in a final show of defiance, grabs the reins, breaks the saddle, and tosses the Colonel off his back. The Colonel is furious and attempts to shoot Spirit, but Little Creek cuts himself free and shoves the gun away. The two then escape, taking all the other horses with them in the process. Once free, Little Creek calls his own horse, a beautiful paint mare named Rain, and jumps onto her. Spirit is momentarily distracted and is caught again, this time by the Lakota.At the Lakota's camp, Spirit is puzzled by Rain and Little Creek's relationship, wondering why a horse would ever accept a human. After a failed attempt to ride Spirit, Little Creek ties Spirit and Rain together and lets them loose. Spirit thinks he's free and starts to run off but Rain stands firm. He relents and lets her show him around her world, falling for her in the process, but still longing to be free. He starts to respect Little Creek too, although he still won't let him on his back. Little Creek finally realizes that no one should ever ride Spirit and sets him free, knowing that the wild is where he belongs. Spirit is ecstatic and immediately finds Rain, wanting her to come with him. But even though she loves him, she feels a kinship with Little Creek and wants to stay with him. While they are together, the Colonel and his men attack the Lakota camp and Rain leaves to help Little Creek, with Spirit hot on her heels trying to stop her. After losing sight of her for a moment he finally spots her, with Little Creek on her back, running toward the Colonel, who levels a gun at them. Rain rears and is shot, with both her and Little Creek falling into a raging river. Little Creek clings to a rock and is almost shot as well, but Spirit rams the Colonel's horse, saving him, and the two share a brief look before Spirit runs off to save Rain, who has been swept away by the current. Although he reaches her, he cannot swim against the rapids and the two are swept over a waterfall. Spirit survives and finds Rain lying on a bank, barely alive. He stays with her all night and is captured by the army again in the morning. They leave Rain, believing that she's not going to make it, and she is found by Little Creek. Little Creek is amazed that Spirit saved his life and pursues the train he is loaded on. Spirit is despondant and on the verge of giving up when the swirling snow outside the car reminds him of his herd and he realizes that he can't give up and must get back to them.Spirit and other horses are used by the railroad to move a steam engine up a steep mountain. Coming over the top, Spirit realizes that the railroad tracks are headed directly towards his homeland and that he must escape and stop them. Thinking quickly, he pretends to faint and, once he is released from his harness, frees the other horses. The engine tumbles down the mountain and smashes the railroad's base, with Spirit barely managing to outrun it. He thinks everything is all right until he realizes that the explosion started a forest fire. He runs but finds a large log in his path. He clears it, but a chain that was still around his neck catches on a branch and he is helpless until Little Creek appears and cuts him loose. The two escape the fire by jumping off a cliff into a river. The next morning they have a joyful reunion which is cut short by the Colonel and his men finding them. Little Creek urges Spirit to run but he doubles back and pushes Little Creek onto his back, much to his surprise. Spirit runs into a canyon and they manage to evade their pursuers, only to find themselves on a high plateau, the only way out being across a deep gorge. Spirit harnesses all his strength and makes a spectacular leap, flying across the chasm to safety. The soldiers arrive on the plateau and one of them attempts to shoot Spirit, but the Colonel grabs the gun. He and Spirit exchange nods of respect before the soldiers leave. The two friends celebrate and Spirit allows Little Creek to ride him back to the Lakota camp. Upon arriving, Spirit is saddened because he does not see Rain, but Little Creek whistles and she appears, perfectly well. Little Creek says goodbye to Rain, realizing her place is with Spirit. He asks Spirit to take care of her, addressing him as \"\"Spirit-who-could-not-be-broken\"\". Although he has waited for this moment for a long time",Spirit finds the goodbye harder than he thought. He and Rain travel to his homeland and find his herd,and his mother,safe and sound. They gallop off

Forever Mine,1999,115,Drama,5.3,Paul Schrader,Paul Schrader,Joseph Fiennes,Joseph Fiennes,Vincent Laresca,Shawn Proctor,"The highly stylized film begins in the early 80's as first class airline passenger, the mysterious and facially scarred Manuel Esquema (Fiennes) reflects on his earlier and significantly different life. Flashbacks take us a decade and a half earlier to a posh Miami hotel where we find that Esquema was really a dashing young cabana boy named Alan Riply. His best friend is fellow cabana boy Javier Cesti (Laresca), who often suggests that the pair would make much more money if they worked for some connections he had in the drug trafficking trade. As fate has it, one day Alan is assigned to the cabana of a wealthy businessman/politician named Mark Brice (Liotta) and his much younger and uber seductive blonde wife, Ella (Mol). Instantly, Alan realizes that he is destined to be with Ella forever and her marriage doesn't deter him in the least from making direct advances. Fortunately for Alan, Ella confesses that she's unhappy and unfulfilled in her marriage, but she's fearful of her powerful mate, so she is reluctant to initiate an affair with Riply. His advances and his raw sexuality are too much for Ella to resist, so the two begin a brief, torrid affair, always careful to avoid detection. When Ella and her husband leave the resort and return to New York, she assumes that the romance is, regrettably but necessarily, over. Not according to Alan who, despite buddy Javier's advice, moves to the big city to pursue Ella. For another brief time the affair is rekindled and all seems magical until Ella's guilt forces her to confess to irate husband Mark. To get revenge, the cuckold Mark uses his connections to have Alan falsely implicated in a drug bust and sentenced to a long haul in jail (which he could have avoided if he'd only agreed to stop pursuing Ella.) Even prison can't stop the blinding lust Alan feels for Ella. He writes deeply moving love letters to her until one is intercepted by her frustrated husband. To end things once and for all, he has a fake escape attempt conducted, during which Riply is to be gunned down. Upon hearing the news of her lover's fate from her guilty-looking mate, Ella accuses him of ordering the hit, which he half-heartedly denies, secure in the belief that his marital ordeal has ended at last. Flash forward to the time in which the story began. The gunshot-disfigured Riply, assuming the name Esquema and accompanied by his equally well-dressed buddy Javier from the cabana days, is arriving by plane at New York. There, he has a meeting with his former nemesis, Mark Brice, who now is in political and legal trouble, even facing time in a federal penitentiary for his various misdeeds. Now altered facially (perhaps not enough to convince the average viewer), Esquema's true identity is hidden, so he works on a deal to do money-laundering and influence peddling for Brice. The reason is clear; Esquema/Riply wants another chance to see and be near Ella, who also fails to recognize him at a dinner meeting. Things come to a head when Esquema/Riply reveals his true identity to Ella and expresses his desire to be with her. At the same time, identity still unknown to Mark, he agrees to a plan in which he helps him avoid a long stint at the Federal Penitentiary in exchange for his wife. As a reunited and blissfully happy Ella and Riply leave New York forever, Mark puts two and two together and furiously pursues them to exact violent revenge. The outcome of the pursuit and the players' fates may not be clear in each viewer's perception.","revenge, violence, flashback",train,imdb

Returning to the bedroom, Tai discovers Botamon has transformed into Koromon, a pink ball-like Digimon resembling a space hopper. This is a process Kari later explains as digivolving, which allows a Digimon to turn into a stronger form, which affects electrical equipment. Kari steals food from the family cat Miko, causing her to attack and scratch both Tai and Koromon. At sunset, Tai and Kari discover Koromon can speak, and he calls them his best friends.That night, another electrical surge causes Koromon to digivolve into Agumon, an enormous but simple-minded dinosaur, who leaps out the window with Kari on his back. Tai pursues them into the night as Agumon wanders the street, scaring Kari when he starts blowing things up with fireballs. A second, enormous Digiegg appears in the sky, hatching to unleash Parrotmon, a large bird-like Digimon able to fire electrical blasts. As Tai reaches Kari, Parrotmon destroys an overpass, burying Agumon under rubble. However, Agumon digivolves into Greymon and battles Parrotmon. Parrotmon knocks Greymon out, but Tai uses Karis whistle to awaken him. Greymon leaps up and obliterates Parrotmon with a fire blast, but the attack destroys him in the process.In narration, Kari explains that she, Tai, and six other children were amongst those who witnessed the battle and were chosen to become the Digidestined. Karis narration about the team acts as a segway into the second act, set in 2000, a year after the events of the television series Digimon Adventure.Koushiro Izzy Izumi, a computer whiz and member of Digidestined, spots a computer virus has somehow appeared on the internet and is attacking something. Getting an image of its target, Izzy amongst thousands of others across the world, witness the virus mutate a Digiegg, causing it to hatch and become a Digimon, which addresses the world with Hello!. Across town, Tai tries to compose an apology letter to his friend Sora Takenouchi after they had a falling out, but he has difficulty deciding whether or not to end the e-mail with love or from. Kari appears, off to a birthday party, sending the e-mail to Sora behind Tais back, but Tai discovers the e-mail was not delivered.A montage follows, showing what the eight Digidestined are up to Sora wanders the streets and checks her hair in a shop window but fails to notice the virus Digimon on a large screen, Joe Kido, the oldest of the group and voice of reason misses a train to an exam for summer school, Matt Ishida and his little brother T.K. are visiting their grandmother in the countryside, Kari attends a friends birthday, and Izzy races for Tais apartment. The eighth member Mimi is absent from home. Tai bemoans to his mother that Kari gets to eat cake and their fridge is empty, so Tais eccentric mother suggests she attempt to make a cake. Izzy appears, informing Tai of the Digimon on the internet.In Tais bedroom, they examine the Digimon. Izzy informs Tai that if the Digimon stays online, it could wipe out all technology. Izzy reveals he got his information from Willis, who is actually a child prodigy and taking classes at college already, though Tai is unimpressed. The Digimon suddenly digivolves, now resembling a cycloptic clawed hand and it starts devouring computer data, causing prices at supermarkets to triple, causing chaos at registers. Tai and Izzy race for the Kamiya computer, with Izzy trying one of Mrs. Kamiyas beef jerky milkshakes. Izzy connects his laptop and the computer together for more power, and explains Willis attempted to get his internet provider to remove the Digimon, but they ignored the threat. Getting online, they discover the Digimon has evolved again, now the creepy-looking Keramon. Not knowing what to do, Tai states he wish his partner Agumon was there (a different character from the Agumon seen in the first act).Agumon suddenly contacts Tai through Izzys laptop, revealing he and the other partners of the Digidestined are aware of Keramon. The Digimon are joined by Gennai, a data entity who appears as an old man. Agumon and Izzys partner, the insectoid Tentomon, agree to go onto the internet to delete Keramon whilst Tai decides to telephone the other Digidestined so their partners can help too. The attempts to phone his friends doesnt go well Joe is too busy to attend (seeing racing into his exam), Matt and T.K.s grandma is too senile to give the phone to them, Mimi is away from home and Tai only gets her answer machine, Kari is unable to come home, and Tai forces Izzy to call Sora due to their issues. Izzy calls Soras house, but she refuses to talk to Tai. Izzy tells Tai and he angrily rants about her attitude, revealing their falling out happened over a lousy hairclip. Sora checks her e-mail to see if Tai sent her anything but finds nothing.Agumon and Tentomon arrive on the internet and find Keramon eating computer data. They attack him, but when Keramon threatens Tai and Izzy, the two digivolve into their Champion-level forms Greymon and Kabuterimon. Keramon suddenly digivolves into Infermon, an armoured spider-like Digimon that proves to be stronger than Greymon and Kabuterimon. Izzy realises he is skipping stages in the digivolution chain and is now on the Ultimate-level. Greymon and Kabuterimon try to do likewise, but Infermon attacks them mid-transformation, wounding both and turning them back into Agumon and Tentomon.Izzy starts receiving e-mails from around the world, including one from Willis who claims the whole thing is his fault and suggests that Tai and Izzy find a way to slow down Infermon. Infermon himself sends an e-mail, which only says Hello repeatedly. Izzy spots the address, realising Infermon is hacking into the phone company and could cause them to lose their internet connection. Tai tries to call his friends but finds the circuits are busy, enraging the phone operator with his constant calls. Infermon calls and asks if Tai is his creator. Kari explains that Infermon was calling every number in the world, looking for his programmer. Izzys internet connection is cut off, forcing him to run home and fetch something, while Tai collapses on the sofa in defeat.A news reporter announces an emergency voicemailing system issued by the government to use the phone, instructing people to leave a message than call back to pick up replies. Tai sends messages to Matt and T.K., Kari, and Sora, inviting her to come to his house so they can talk about their issues. Sora arrives but hesitates at the last minute and stomps away. Tai leaves a message for Mimi, but his mother reveals they got a postcard from Mimi, who is on vacation in Hawaii cut to an ecstatic Mimi in Hawaii who doesnt have a care in the world. Izzy returns and reveals to Tai he has a satellite uplink device which will let them hack into a military satellite system to regain internet access.Tai checks the phone messages, discovering Matt and T.K. have left messages. Tai informs them of the situation, so Matt and T.K. rush off into town to find a computer to use. Tai and Izzy go back online and find Infermon has gone, now causing havoc in New York City. Matt and T.K. contact Tai and Izzy via a webcam, revealing they are using a computer in a barber shop, where a group of eccentric patrons watch their endeavours. Agumon and Tentomon are deployed to battle Infermon again, but are join by Matt and T.K.s partners Gabumon and Patamon. Confronting Infermon, Agumon and Gabumon immediately digivolve to their Mega-level forms WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon.The two beat Infermon down, and Patamon tries to digivolve as well. Infermon suddenly dashes at him, digivolving into his Mega-level form Diaboromon. Diaboromon uses his extendable arms to knock out Patamon and pin Tentomon down. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon battle Diaboromon, getting the advantage. However, Izzy suddenly gets severe cramps and runs for the bathroom, blaming Mrs. Kamiyas recipes. Matt informs Tai that the Digimon are slowing down for some reason. Tai angrily slams the computer, causing it to malfunction, and WarGreymon freezes in place. Izzy returns and has to reboot the computer. He and Tai argue but then the subject turns to Sora. Tai explains he bought Sora a hairpin for her birthday, but she took offence, believing Tai disliked her hairstyle and they fell out. Izzy is stunned by the silly reason, but the attention is drawn back to the computer, discovering WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon have been defeated.Diaboromon sends an e-mail to Izzy, asking Who can count backwards from ten?. The Digidestined witness Diaboromon create a countdown, and then he starts cloning himself. Izzy is informed by Willis that the American governments systems have been hacked and Diaboromon has fired two nuclear missiles, possibly through Izzys satellite uplink, and they will hit their targets in ten minutes, thus explaining the countdown. The two targets are Colorado and Tais neighbourhood. Izzy explains every other country is trying to intercept the nukes, but their own missiles are made useless by Diaboromon and crash in the ocean near Hawaii.Izzy concludes that if they destroy all of the Diaboromon clones until the original one remains, then they can stop the countdown, only to discover there are over 75,000 clones and rising. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon decide to go after Diaboromon, and Izzy realises the e-mails he is getting are slowing down their Digimon. The Digimon race to stop Diaboromon, entering a large circular chamber where Diaboromons clones swarm. They all attack at once, easily overwhelming WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon. Both are rendered unconscious. Tai despairs and moves towards the computer, wanting to help WarGreymon. Mrs. Kamiya enters offering more juice but notices Tai has disappeared. Kari explains that Tais bond with WarGreymon was so strong, it allows him to enter the internet and become digital, the same happening to Matt.Tai speaks to WarGreymon, encouraging him to not give up and people from all over the world are supporting him. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon awaken, harnessing the data from the e-mails, and fuse together into one Digimon Omnimon. Omnimon easily wipes out all of the Diaboromon clones, leaving only the original, but he is so fast that Omnimon doesnt have time to aim at him. With only thirty seconds left, Izzy realises he can send the e-mails to Diaboromons address, slowing him down like they did to their Digimon. Diaboromon slows down, allowing Omnimon to spot him.Ten seconds left, the missiles head for their targets, while Omnimon dashes at Diaboromon, running him through with his sword with only two seconds to go. Diaboromon is deleted, and the missiles land harmlessly, one crashing into Tokyo Bay without detonating. Mrs. Kamiyas cake is charred in the microwave, and Sora finally receives Tais e-mail, noting the love at the end, and makes amends with him. Elsewhere in Colorado, Willis celebrates with his Digimon, only for a strange phenomenon to appear and capture Kokomon.The films third act takes place four years later, with the introduction of the second generation of Digidestined introduced in the series Digimon Adventure 02. T.K. and Kari are in New York with the intent on visiting Mimi, but Kari senses a strange feeling in the air. Nearby, the teenage Willis flees from Kokomon, who has digivolved into an enormous ape-like Digimon (actually called Wendigomon, but he is only called Kokomon throughout the film). Kokomon cryptically informs Willis to go back and to destroy. Gummymon has digivolved into Terriermon, a floppy-earred Digimon who looks more like a rabbit than a dog. Kokomon and Terriermon fight in the back alleys of Manhattan, until Kokomon defeats his smaller twin.Willis tries to get more information from Kokomon, but he disappears into mist. Kari, T.K., Gatomon and Patamon witness the battle but Willis flees when they call out to him. Patamon follows Willis, witnessing him call his mother at a payphone and learns he is going to Colorado. The Digidestined head to Colorado on the train, Kari deciding to contact their friends for backup. On a beach, Davis Motomiya, Yolei Inoue, and Cody Hida, along with their partners, DemiVeemon, Poromon, and Upamon, learn of the situation but are hapless on how to get to America. T.K. and Karis train is suddenly attacked by Kokomon who causes the train to halt in the middle of nowhere, warning them not to interfere.Meanwhile, the others arrive in America and get across country by hitching rides with Yoleis large number of uncles who happen to live in the United States including a reckless cab driver, and a pilot who drops them off in a delivery plane. Davis eventually gets fed up with the travel and shouts, alerting a truck driver who pulls over, and the group hitch a ride on the truck. Inside the trailer, they meet Willis and Terriermon. A little later, the group accompanied by Willis and Terriermon, stand on the roadside. Willis is thrilled to meet other people with Digimon and flirts with Yolei. Davis is impatient to reach Kari, and Willis suggests waiting for them at his summer home in Colorado, calling a pizza delivery guy he knows to pick them up. The delivery man arrives moments later, but he drives off before Davis and Willis can get on.Kokomon materialises, Davis sending DemiVeemon to attack him by digivolving into Veemon. Veemon, Davis, and Terriermon try to fend off Kokomon by flying at him, but crash into a billboard. Veemon digivolves into Flamedramon, but Kokomon easily defeats him. Willis tries to reason with Kokomon, who tells him to go back to the beginning. Willis Digivice, which can be used to help a Digimon digivolve, springs to life, allowing Terriermon to digivolve into Gargomon, a large rabbit who has gun turrets attached to his arms. Gargomon battles Kokomon and defeats him, but he disappears. Willis worries that Kokomon will hurt Davis and the others, but Terriermon tells him that they are a team.Needing transport to reach Yolei and Cody, Veemon digivolves into Raidramon, and they race across Colorado to Willis summer house. Realising T.K. and Kari havent arrived yet, Willis guesses Kokomon likely stalled them. Davis, Yolei, and Cody ask Willis how he knows Kokomon, but he gets upset and leaves, followed by Davis. By nightfall, the two have been wandering for hours and Davis asks Willis what he is afraid of. Willis reluctantly explains that after he got Terriermon and Kokomon, he got the idea to try and create his own Digimon on the internet, but it was attacked by a virus and mutated into Diaboromon. But while Diaboromon was destroyed, the virus survived, somehow appeared in the real world and infected Kokomon, turning him into his present self, and he is obsessed with chasing Willis. Willis assumes that Kokomons cryptic words are about going back to where the virus attacked him, but he cant be sure. Davis encourages Willis to join their team, further supported by an eavesdropping Terriermon.The next day, the Digidestined go to the field where Kokomon was infected, and the big ape arrives. Willis asks him what he wants but Kokomon is unable to speak anything other than Destroy! He suddenly digivolves again, becoming Antylamon, a tall rabbit-like Digimon. Veemon, Terriermon, and the evolved Hawkmon and Armadillomon digivolve to battle Antylamon. Gargomon and Flamedramon corner Antylamon, but he sinks beneath the river and disappears. Antylamon digivolves and rises as the nightmarish Cherubimon, who is able to make the Digimon de-digivolve to their Rookie forms. The group try to fight him as they are but are defeated. T.K. and Kari arrive with their digivolved partners, now Angemon and Angewomon, who are able to put up a decent fight against Cherubimon until he covers the whole area in darkness.","","",""

Tuck Everlasting,2002,90,Drama,6.6,Jay Russell,Natalie Babbitt,William Hurt,Ben Kingsley,Jonathan Jackson,Richard Pilcher,"\"Tuck Everlasting opens in the present day, in the town of Treegap. Cars and pedestrian traffic make their way through the streets. Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson) rides his motorcycle through the town and makes his way to a gated house on the outskirts. He takes off his helmet and looks at the estate wistfully.A narrator for the movie (Elisabeth Shue) recites a passage on the nature of time, and notes that for the Tuck family, it didn't exist. As the scenery shifts to show a peaceful forest, the narrator goes on to say that the story begins on the first week of summer, 'not so very long ago,' when Treegap was a quaint village, and Mae Tuck (Sissy Spacek) went there every ten years to meet up with her sons.After a brief image of a stately tree, with a T carved into the bark, the scenery changes to show Treegap as it was in 1914. Mae rides her horse-drawn wagon through the dirt streets. She window-shops along several stores, before sitting in her wagon, playing a wistful tune on her small music box. Mae's sons, Miles (Scott Bairstow) and Jesse make their way to her, and there is an emotional reunion. Jesse has brought some gifts for Mae: a small bronze replica of the Eiffel Tower, bought in Paris, and a box of French chocolate. Miles proves much more emotionally restrained than Jesse; the hug he gives his mother moves her to say, albeit affectionately, 'You're as cozy as barbed wire.' But more than anything, she's happy that they're back after ten years.We then see the Foster estate, and young Winnie Foster (Alexis Bledel) lays on the lawn, staring out into space and daydreaming, before her mother (Amy Irving) calls her inside. The Fosters are a wealthy family; the estate is gated and the mansion is well-furnished and appointed. Winnie is shown to be given a strict upbringing to be a proper lady of the time, which involves constant piano practice in the parlor, and having to dress properly, including a corset she finds very uncomfortable. She is also schooled in playing croquet. The narrator explains that the formality of Winnie's life is stifling her and leaving her without time or chance to be the two things she needs to be most: a teenager, and a girl. As Winnie continues piano practice under the watchful eye of her mother and grandmother, the narrator says that the need for, and feeling of, change was drawing ever closer and more strongly.Winnie rides with her mother into town, who's come to pick up cakes from the bakery for a formal tea party. As Mrs. Foster goes into the bakery, Winnie, still in the automobile, lifts her veil and turns to watch some boys playing stickball in the streets. The boys happen to look in her direction, and recognize her. One approaches her and starts to make fun of her, sitting prim and proper in her fancy car (cars being rare in 1914). He challenges her to step out of the car and get her feet dirty.Mrs. Foster, in the bakery, fusses over the various pastries available in the bakery and says that none of them are satisfactory for the tea party. The baker is offering to make them up special for her, when Mrs. Foster suddenly hears the sound of the kids outside cheering, and calling Winnie's name. Turning, she sees to her horror that Winnie has stepped out of the car and joined the stickball game, hitting the ball and running around the bases. Winnie is smiling as she reaches home plate for a home run, but her fun is cut short when her mother storms out and puts a stop to it.In a secluded cabin in the woods outside Treegap, the Tuck family makes their home. There is merry in the air as Jesse demonstrates a French dance, and the family patriarch, Angus Tuck (William Hurt) looks through an early-model picture animator. Miles, however, proves to be in a broody and dark mood, even when his father says he's glad to have his sons home. Miles tells Angus, also sometimes just called Pa Tuck or Tuck for short, that he's probably going to be leaving soon; he's heard early stories of war brewing and he plans to sign up to fight 'against the Huns.'When Angus asks if fighting in a war will solve things, and whether Miles has seen enough killing for two lifetimes, Miles reveals another motive for getting as far from Treegap as he can: he knows that someone is on to them; knows or suspects a secret about the Tucks that they need to keep from people, at all costs. As Miles speaks about how a strange man has been following him and Jesse, and keeps reappearing even though they lose him several times, a flashback is shown of Miles and Jesse stowing away on the caboose of a locomotive, and a Man in a Yellow Suit (Sir Ben Kingsley; unnamed, and will be referred to hereafter as MITYS, for Man In The Yellow Suit) standing on the tracks behind the train as it pulls away, looking intently at the two brothers. Miles is sure that MITYS knows something about the Tucks that they can't let anyone know about them.Angus, however, says it was only a matter of time before someone found them. The Industrial Revolution has led to increasing settlement everywhere, and the world is closing in on them. The forest they've called home for a long time, is shrinking as continued population growth clears it away for further building of civilization. A few weeks ago, Angus saw tire tracks on the lower marsh, and he knows there will be more. Mae, Jesse and Miles are quiet and deeply thoughtful as Pa Tuck tells them all that they must not go into town again for anything, and that if they see anyone too close to their home in the woods, they 'know what to do.'Evening at the Foster Estate. Winnie is trying to catch fireflies fluttering about among the trees. A man's voice tells her she's going about it the wrong way. Winnie turns and sees MITYS standing just outside the estate's gate. Though he admits never having tried catching fireflies himself, he proves to know the way of a hunter, explaining it to Winnie, and then quickly catching a firefly in his hand, that drifts too close to him. Letting the insect go, he explains to Winnie that he's looking for some old friends who live in the area, and he was hoping that someone in the Foster family could point him in the right direction. Winnie innocently (and perhaps, a bit carelessly) says that her father, Robert Foster (Victor Garber), practically built Treegap through the resources of his business, and he owns much of the land around it.Mrs. Foster comes up at that moment, and MITYS starts to introduce himself, and to explain that he's looking for a certain family he hopes the Fosters can help him find. But before MITYS can tell her the name of the family, Mrs. Foster, more brusquely and less warmly than Winnie, says she doesn't know, nor want to know, everyone in the town, and she doesn't discuss the issue with people she's never met. Accepting the statement without changing expression, MITYS bids her good night. As Mrs. Foster leads Winnie back to the house, scolding her for speaking to strangers so freely, MITYS begins to whistle a curious and very familiar tune.The next day, Mr. and Mrs. Foster are telling Winnie that they're sending her to the Middlehouse Academy for Girls in Pensford, supposedly one of the finest, most reputable schools for teaching girls to become proper ladies of the upper-crust society. Winnie has heard of Middlehouse; the stories that have reached her about their 'curriculum' frightens her to death. But the Fosters insist that her desire not to go through such a rigid and unmerciful method of schooling in 'ladylike manners and etiquette' are exactly why she needs to. But Winnie rebels. Running from the parlor, she angrily shouts that she won't go to such a terrible place.Winnie runs to the gate, clutching the bars like the bars of a prison cell, as the narrator says that the Fosters failed to understand one thing: Winnie was to be sent 500 miles away to be educated, but all she wanted was to step outside her own fence. And so she did.Winnie wanders into the woods, exploring the forest. Although the woods are peaceful and there is no danger about, it soon becomes clear that Winnie is lost, struggling to find her way about. Pushing her way through some brush, she hears the sound of gurgling water. Moving toward it, she finds a curious site.Jesse Tuck kneels at the base of a large, beautiful tree that has a letter T carved into the trunk. Jesse is drinking from a small spring of water bubbling up into a small hollow between the tree's huge roots. Winnie slowly steps out into the open, approaching closer as Jesse splashes some water onto his face. Standing, he turns, and he's startled on seeing Winnie. Looking around warily, he asks her how long she's been standing there, and admonishes her for coming into this part of the woods, and she should turn and go home. Taking a bit of defiance at the statement, Winnie boldly tells Jesse that her family owns the woods and she can stay as long as she feels like. When Winnie tells Jesse her name, he recognizes the surname Foster, and doesn't look completely pleased to hear it. He restates his belief that Winnie needs to go back home, and Winnie, matching his slightly curt tone, says she was on her way... but admits she's lost. Jesse, seeming to have an idea of where the Foster estate is, offers to guide Winnie back. Winnie is grateful for the offer, but says that she's thirsty and needs a drink first.All at once Jesse starts acting a little oddly in trying to keep Winnie away from the spring. His initial excuses carry no credibility, but when Winnie tries to move past him, he resorts to grabbing her and blocking her from the spring. Pulling away, Winnie starts to run, threatening to have Jesse arrested. As she runs, a piece of her dress sleeve catches on a branch and tears off. Jesse starts to give pursuit as Winnie runs-- straight into Miles, who catches and intercepts her. Despite Jesse suddenly saying they can't do what they're doing, Miles coldly says that they have to do what Pa Tuck said, no exceptions. Holding fast to Winnie, Miles half pulls, half drags her to his horse, and rides off with her, Jesse running in pursuit.A brief shot of the Foster estate shows that Mr. and Mrs. Foster are keenly aware of how long Winnie has been gone. A maidservant calls out into the woods from just behind the fence.Miles arrives at the Tuck cabin with Winnie as his prisoner. Seeing the girl struggle with Miles, Mae runs up, scolding Miles and trying to comfort Winnie-- until Miles tells Mae that he caught Winnie at the spring with Jesse... and that Winnie is a Foster. All of the Tuck family knows the Foster name, and Mae is in shock, saying softly, 'it's finally happened.'For the immediate moment, Mae has a frightened teenage girl on her hands, begging to go home. Asking Miles to fetch Pa Tuck, who's across the lake, Mae turns back to Winnie and again tries to comfort her, promising to bring her back home as soon as she can.As Miles goes to bring Tuck back, Mae starts to pace around. She pulls out her music box and begins turning the handle. Winnie looks closely at Mae as she listens to the music. She recognizes the tune, though she doesn't tell Mae from where. Prattling as much to herself as to Winnie, Mae says she found the music box in the forest one day, and she used to put Miles and Jesse to bed with it every night, and the music always gave them good dreams.The sun has set and very early evening has fallen when Miles and Jesse return to the cabin with Pa Tuck. Mae has been trying to tend to Winnie, who's still deeply upset at having been kidnapped and brought here by force; she still feels like a prisoner even though Mae tries to assure her that she's not. Tuck slowly approaches Winnie, peering curiously at her, before calling his family into a huddle. Although they speak in whispers, Winnie can still clearly overhear much of the coversation; Angus asks Miles and Jesse 'does she know?' and they're concerned about her being a Foster. Getting impatient, Winnie asks them out loud what they think she knows about them.Introducing her husband to Winnie, Mae calls him Angus for the first time. Angus slowly approaches Winnie again, offering his hand for a handshake, although Winnie is still too nervous to do so. Seeing this, Angus quietly asks her if she's hungry, and Mae very agreeably suggests they all have dinner.Winnie sits with the Tucks at the dinner table, but hardly eats. She finally tells them that her father will come looking for her. She thinks that an offer of ransom money to the Tucks will expedite her return home. Angus and Mae gently insist they don't want any of her family's money, even though they know how wealthy Mr. Foster is, and they intend to bring her safely home; although Angus points out, as much to his family as anyone else, that they need to know how much they can trust Winnie. Miles immediately protests, saying that Winnie can't be trusted any more than any 'normal person.' When Jesse tries to defend Winnie, saying he believes that she won't turn on the family, Miles gets angry. He holds Jesse responsible for whatever predicament the Tucks believe themselves to be in. Calling Jesse a fool, Miles curtly leaves the dinner table and the cabin.Mrs. Foster stares out the window of her estate. She stares at the front gate, her mouth opening in recognition, and calls urgently for her husband.Mr. Foster is speaking to Henry, the constable of Treegap (Richard Pilcher). He tells Henry that Mrs. Foster suspects MITYS, who'd been speaking to Winnie at the gate the other night. But Henry surprises Mr. Foster by bringing him into the constabulary office-- where MITYS sits. MITYS admits that he was talking to Winnie at the estate, and he remembers her well, but he doesn't know where she is at the moment. He's in town searching for a family he used to know, and had come to the constabulary for help, and when he spoke to Winnie at the Foster estate, she thought Mr. Foster might be able to help. MITYS hands Mr. Foster and old photograph showing a young man wearing a Civil War era Union military uniform. He says the family is named Tuck, and they're long-lost relatives, as he claims. On his way out, MITYS says that although he doesn't know where Winnie is now, he's willing to join the search for her, saying he's talented at finding people.Mae has curtained off an area of the house so Winnie can sleep in privacy. She helps Winnie out of her corset, a garment Mae finds distasteful; saying that torturing themselves is no way for young women to live. Mae has no daughters, but she says she does have a granddaughter, and grandson. Their names are Anna and Beau, and a small photograph of them is in a locket Mae wears. But Winnie notices Mae saying that Miles 'loved them so--' past tense. Mae only says that the children have passed on, along with their mother, and that all the good parts of Miles died along with them.Mae helps Winnie into a sleeping gown, making further small talk. Winnie now feels safe around Mae, consenting to Mae calling her by her first name. Before retiring to bed, Mae smiles kindly at Winnie, saying it's a good feeling having another woman at the cabin.MITYS is in the town cemetery, looking reverently at one of the graves. The priest of the church finds his way to MITYS, asking if he's lost. MITYS drops the name Tuck, asking if the priest has heard of it. When told no, MITYS says he didn't think the priest would know of any Tucks in the cemetery, and then makes a curious comment, 'or in any other.'Suddenly MITYS approaches the priest closer, a puzzled look on his face, as he asks what the priest believes most people desire as he tends to them on their deathbeds. He offers whether they would desire more time. MITYS' dialogue starts to turn ominous as he speaks about how much people would give to live forever, and suddenly asking the priest if he's prepared to die-- how much would he desire to live forever, never growing old or sick. As suddenly as the conversation started, it ends, as MITYS bids the priest good night and takes his leave, whistling the curious, wistful tune.Dawn is just breaking when Jesse awakens Winnie, asking her if she'd like to see the Eiffel Tower. Sleepily, she mumbles that someday it would be a nice thing. But Jesse says he wants to take her now-- 'while the day is still ours.'A shot of the Foster estate, where Mr. Foster and Henry are organizing a large search party for Winnie, shows that Jesse might have the right idea. Mr. Foster gives Henry one of Winnie's nightgowns so the search dogs can get her scent. It doesn't take long before one of the searchers and dog handlers finds the scrap of fabric torn from Winnie's dress when she was running away from Jesse.Now, rather than running away from him, Winnie is running with him, through the woods to a tall stone hill-- Jesse's 'Eiffel Tower,' which he says is two feet higher than the real one in Paris. Jesse takes Winnie on an arduous climb to the top of the stone hill, which Jesse admits is more difficult than the long stairway to the top of the tower in Paris.As they climb, Winnie asks Jesse how old he is. He looks young, but he says he's been to the real Eiffel Tower in Paris. Jesse tells Winnie that he's 104 years old. When Winnie asks for a serious answer, Jesse says he is being serious, but then gives in and agrees to 'call it 17.'Winnie and Jesse reach the top of the stone hill, where they take time to enjoy the majestic, panoramic view.As the search party continues, and MITYS also appears to be searching on his own, and Mrs. Foster plays the piano to try and keep her mind busy, time continues to pass. Watching Tuck and Mae at work around the cabin, running through the woods with Jesse, Winnie loses track of how long she's been staying with the Tucks. The family lives a simple lifestyle, never in a rush for anything. Winnie starts enjoying her time with them. She's also falling in love with Jesse.Jesse takes her to a short waterfall where it empties into a stream. At first, she's surprised when he starts undressing to his underwear, until he dives off the rock they were sitting on, into the water, and swims around. He invites Winnie to join him, but Winnie can't swim and is afraid. Taking this news with surprise, Jesse says that he'll just have to enjoy the swim on his own. Emboldened by this, taking it as a challenge, Winnie takes off her outer dress and jumps into the water with Jesse. He catches her easily, keeping her afloat and swimming around with her.The light-hearted, playful, and loving mood is in sharp contrast to the ever-brooding Miles, who is in town, intoxicated, beating out several opponents in poker at a saloon. One of the disgruntled players quickly assumes that Miles is cheating. Miles, however, proves he's exceptionally sharp at counting the position of each card in the deck, particularly the aces. But when the sore loser asks if Miles is looking for trouble, Miles eagerly says that he is; this leads to the saloon bouncer tossing Miles out. Miles doesn't even seem to mind this, taking it all with a drunken chuckle.But Miles is unaware of another patron at the saloon: MITYS, who becomes alerted to the commotion, sees Miles, and discreetly starts to follow him.Jesse has built a campfire, and encourages Winnie to listen to the various types of bird songs and calls throughout the woods. The bird calls sound like soulful music, and Winnie smiles and starts to sway side to side as she listens. Jesse takes a stick and starts to play a percussion tune against a fallen log, and Winnie dances, starting to feel at one with nature. Jesse joins her, and the two of them dance passionately. Unaware that MITYS is searching through the woods purposefully.Still later, Winnie lays beside the campfire with Jesse, snuggling peacefully with him. But when Winnie innocently says that she wishes the moment could last forever, Jesse starts to turn thoughtful, his words chosen with care. He tells Winnie that they could see the world together, and have a million moments like this one. There's a secret about the Tucks that Winnie doesn't yet know; something Jesse has sworn never to tell anyone, even her. A secret that forces the Tuck Family to live apart from the rest of society, hiding from civilization. Winnie is the first person Jesse's met, that he wanted to tell the secret to. Winnie, not realizing how serious Jesse is, leans in and kisses him.The kiss breaks Jesse; makes him want to tell Winnie the truth. Reminding her about the giant oak tree where they met, and the spring bubbling up from it, Jesse tells Winnie the truth about himself and his family: They're immortal. Jesse truly is 104 years old; he just stopped aging at 17. Jesse is certain that the spring is what caused it. He's going to be 17 years old until the end of the world.Twigs suddenly start breaking behind Jesse and Winnie, and they spin around to look. Miles has found them; his intoxication is wearing off fast, although he's not quite sober yet. Miles and Jesse immediately fall into an argument; Miles challenging Winnie on whether she'd have preferred to learn the truth before she kissed Jesse, and asking if Jesse has told her the downsides of being immortal. Getting upset, Jesse accuses Miles of not wanting Jesse to have what Miles lost. Interceding between the brothers, Winnie asks to hear the whole truth.Miles begins to tell the story. He, Jesse, Tuck and Mae all had a drink from the spring as they were heading further west to build a homestead. Their horse drank as well, but their cat didn't; Miles insists this one small detail is important. The water tasted heavenly, and Tuck carved a large T into the trunk to mark the tree as a landmark for the family. They found a good place to build their homestead, and it was soon after that they began to realize that something was different about them. Jesse climbed a tree, and fell thirty feet to the ground, landing with all his weight atop his neck. But before Mae could let out a yell of grief, Jesse got back to his feet as if nothing happened. No pain, no broken bones.Miles' face and voice start to gradually turn darker as he says that this wasn't all. Things began happening. The family horse was shot by hunters who mistook it for a deer. But the bullets simply bounced off the horse's flank, barely leaving a mark in its hide. Tuck was bitten by a rattlesnake, and lived through the poison without becoming ill. It was the cat who finally died; from old age.Miles starts fingering the wedding ring he wears, remembering further. He fell in love and married, having two beautiful children with his wife. The children were named Anna and Beau. He and his family eventually built their own homestead not far from the rest of the Tucks. But by now, Tuck had figured out that the spring had made them all immortal. Miles knew he wouldn't age, and nothing could kill him; over time his own children would be older than he; his wife growing old and dying while he lived on. Needing to save them, Miles pleaded with his wife to come to the spring with him, so she and the kids could drink and live forever with him. Miles' wife didn't take Miles seriously; she thought he and his family had sold their souls to the devil. As people began to talk, word spread around and everyone in the area thought that the Tucks were dabbling in black magic and witchcraft. They burnt the homestead, looking to kill the Tucks, and of course the Tucks couldn't die. This is why they withdrew from civilization, keeping themselves hidden from people.In his grief, becoming increasingly bitter, Miles began fighting in wars. He fought in the Mexican-American war, watching many brave soldiers die during the siege of Veracruz. He fought in the Civil War, watching casualties mount at Gettysburg. He prayed that an enemy soldier would kill him as well-- but no bullet could do this. Miles couldn't die. But the most painful loss was his family. Influenza took Anna before she turned 15. If Beau were still alive, he'd be close to eighty. And Miles' beloved wife... died old and alone in an insane asylum.Both Miles and Winnie are in tears as the story ends.Miles, Jesse and Winnie return to the Tuck cabin early the following morning. Tuck and Mae immediately know that Jesse has told Winnie the truth about them. Tuck says he needs speak with Winnie one on one, and takes her out onto the lake in a rowboat.Angus Tuck looks all around at the living forest around them, asking Winnie to do the same. He talks about human lives, how Winnie was once a child, and is now a young woman; one day she'll have children and do something important-- and then she'll pass on, making way for new life. The Tucks, as Angus insists, don't truly live as other people do; they simply 'are.' Like rocks stuck at the side of a stream. Angus softly insists to Winnie that the secret she's learned is extremely dangerous; if people learned about the spring, they'd trample and kill each other in a mad rush to it. As Angus says, people are so desperate not to die, that they also never live the lives they have.Winnie admits she's afraid of dying, asking if that's a bad thing. Angus says it isn't, but to never live one's life is so much worse than dying, which Angus calls merely 'part of the wheel.' The one thing Angus asks Winnie to understand, is to fear an unlived life, rather than death.But there's one thing both Angus Tuck and Winnie should fear; they just don't know it. MITYS has found them. From a secluded spot on the shore, he looks through his binoculars and watches the two of them as they sit in the rowboat.MITYS goes to the Foster estate to inform Mr. and Mrs. Foster that he knows where Winnie is. He tells them that she appears to have been with the Tuck family for some time now. But it doesn't take long to show that MITYS is far less concerned for the welfare of either Winnie or her parents, than his own agenda. His seemingly idle statement that he's the only person who knows where Winnie can be found, and therefore brought safely home, shows Mr. Foster that MITYS has a price for divulging this information.MITYS briefly beats around the bush before finally getting to the point; in return for bringing the Fosters and a search party to the Tuck cabin, MITYS wants ownership of the woods around Treegap. He's not interested in the town itself; just the immediate surrounding forest. Both of the Fosters are sickened by the play, but Mrs. Foster begs her husband to give MITYS whatever he asks, so she can finally have Winnie back.As MITYS leaves the estate, Mr. Foster hands him the proper papers that make him the owner of the woods around Treegap. MITYS assures the Fosters that their ordeal is over, but they have to move quickly; the Tucks were packing up to leave the cabin and the forest. MITYS suggests that Constable Henry organize a posse quickly so that the Tucks can be arrested. MITYS says he's also heading to the cabin himself, and he's sure to arrive before anyone else.The posse organizes under Constable Henry at the Foster estate, and Mr. Foster says he's coming along himself.The Tucks are loading up their wagon and making final preparations to leave their cabin. Jesse is tasked with bringing Winnie back home. But their last few moments together are interrupted by the arrival of MITYS, who's found his way to their home. Angus quickly recognizes MITYS as the man who's been following and tracking Miles and Jesse. MITYS reveals how he found the Tucks, and how he learned their secret in the first place: his grandmother was an employee at the insane asylum where Miles' wife was confined, and MITYS took the stories of her ranting and raving about a people in the woods that could live forever, to heart. Miles' wife often rambled about a music box that always had a calming effect on her children. MITYS whistles the tune from the music box; Mae's music box.MITYS reveals that Mr. Foster has signed ownership of the woods to him. He offers to ensure that the Tucks can remain at their cabin indefinitely, safe from the outside world; what MITYS wants in return is knowledge of where the spring is. His motive for this is finally revealed as pure greed; MITYS knows that people desperate to live forever, would pay him all of their worldly goods and material wealth, down to the smallest coin, in return for one sip from the spring.When Angus refuses to meet this demand, MITYS grabs Winnie and pulls a gun, menacing the girl with it. Jesse lunges at MITYS, who shoots automatically. Jesse falls briefly, but is unhurt; proving his immortality. The Tucks are in a standoff with MITYS, who continues to hold Winnie at gunpoint.But MITYS has turned his back to Mae. Mae picks up her husband's shotgun by its barrel, and swinging with all her strength, clubs MITYS across the back of the head with the stock of the weapon. Just then, Constable Henry's rescue team starts to converge on the cabin. Miles and Jesse escape on horseback as Mr. Foster races to the cabin and hugs Winnie in relief.Back at the Foster home, Mr. and Mrs. Foster can't understand or accept Winnie defending the Tucks or that she's come to love them all as dear friends. She insists that Mae was only protecting her when she hit MITYS from behind. But Henry reveals that it's all irrelevant. MITYS has died from the blow, meaning Mae, who is locked in the town jail with Angus, will be charged with murder, and she'll be hanged for it. Henry sadly tells Mr. Foster that Winnie will be required to testify. Henry finds MITYS as much a slick weasel and scoundrel as Mr. Foster does, but Mae will still face the gallows for killing him.It's a dark and stormy night, and Winnie lays in bed, trying to sleep, when she's alerted to a sound at her window. Jesse has climbed up there, come to seek her help. If his mother goes to the gallows, she won't die from the hanging, and the Tuck family's secret will be out. Winnie agrees they have to get Mae and Angus sprung from jail somehow. Jesse has a plan how.Winnie runs to the jail and pounds on the door, screaming in terror for help. The night watchman jailer answers the door and Winnie staggers in, crying fearfully that the people who kidnapped her have come back for her again, and if they catch her, they'll kill her. The jailer grabs his rifle and goes outside, where Jesse and Miles slowly walk toward the building, dressed in dark cloaks and top hats, brandishing sabers. They approach the jailer slowly and menacingly. The jailer fires at them, and they fall to the ground, but then slowly rise again. The jailer runs away in fear as Winnie grabs spare jail cell keys and frees Angus and Mae.Miles has brought the family wagon to the square. Mae and Jesse both hug Winnie, wishing she could come with them, but both Angus and Winnie know that Mr. Foster would hunt them all across the country without letup. Jesse gets an idea. He begs Winnie to drink from the spring. Then when it was safe, he would come back for her and they could see the whole world, starting with the Eiffel Tower. As the Tucks ride off in the wagon, he pledges to love her until his dying day.Back at the Foster House, Winnie's grandmother lies on her deathbed. Winnie sees Mrs. Foster lay down beside Grandma Foster, staying by her side until she's gone. After Grandma Foster's funeral, Winnie finds her mother staring out at the woods. Mrs. Foster admits she was heartbroken at the thought of losing Winnie, who was growing up very fast, and wanted to keep her baby as her little girl. Winnie and her mother make peace, and as summer draws to a close, The Fosters drive off, leaving Treegap to see the world.The scene changes back to show Treegap as it is in the present day (presumably 2002, the year the movie was released). We return to the first scene, where Jesse Tuck has returned to the town. He rides his motorcycle through the streets, and looks wistfully at what used to be the Foster estate, and the cars parked on its property. Jesse then walks through the forest and finds his way to the magic spring, where Winnie waits for him...She's buried there.Jesse sinks to his knees as he looks on Winnie's gravestone. Having chosen never to drink from the spring, Winnie went on to marry, have children, and live a full life, before she passed away in 1999 at the venerable age of 100. To forever safeguard the magic spring, she arranged that she be buried at the base of the tree from which the spring flowed; her gravestone forever sealing it up so that nobody would again find it.As Jesse turns his gaze to the sky, the narrator delivers her closing recitation: \"\"Tuck said it to Winnie the summer she turned 15. 'Do not fear death","but rather the unlived life. You don't have to live forever; you just have to live.' And she did.\"\"The view pans up along the upper branches of the trees and fades to black.\"","philosophical, murder, flashback",train

Jewel, a former prostitute herself, has a new girl, Carol, who's working out well, and Jewel just knows that if Carol and Sonny worked doubles, her son servicing the woman while Carol takes the man, they'd make big money.However, Sonny has other plans. His army friend Jesse has promised Sonny a job at his father's Texas bookstore. Sonny just needs some good clothes and a bit of traveling money. While trying on suits (and asking if there's a job opening), Sonny is interrupted by Meg, a former client who tells her friend Sonny is the one she's gushed about. It's clear she's still interested.Jewel's boyfriend Henry, a shoplifter and thief who barely makes enough to rent a room, buy a bottle, and pay his losses at his daily gin game with his friend, pours Sonny a drink. It's too late for him, Henry explains, but Sonny can still get out, do something with his life.Sonny and Carol soon sleep together. She is duly impressed with Sonny's skills as a lover, so much so that she not only pays him but loans him the car she's borrowed from Troy, a car-dealer client who asks Carol to marry him often. On arrival in Texas, Sonny is disappointed to learn there is no job. Jesse's father has died, leaving debts, and the bookstore has a new owner.Jesse has something for Sonny, though. His girlfriend has a sister Gretchen, a pretty blond. Why don't they go on a double date? Sonny isn't sure; he's been with lots of women but never had a date. Jesse convinces him to give it a chance. They pick the girls up at church, spend the day and the evening with them, and Sonny ends up having sex with Gretchen, who jokingly suggests that since Sonny's job disappeared, he should do that for a living.He tells her he used to. Gretchen fails at covering her appalled reaction. She gets up, ostensibly to use the bathroom, but Sonny finds her drinking cough syrup to get high. He loses his temper, throwing the bottle, which shatters, then tearing the bathroom apart, finding more, throwing them, shouting at her for being a junkie. Jesse is angry, and the girls yell at Sonny to get out.Sonny drives home. A business acquaintance who runs her own whorehouse refers Sonny to a client, and it's Meg, whose husband is out of town.

He accepts $150 and her promise to refer any friends who could use his services.Meg comes through, sending Sonny (in a hastily-borrowed police uniform Henry got for him) to the lavish home of an older woman with a cop fetish. Sonny is grossed out by what she asks that he do with his nightstick, but he needs the money.

This therefore is my limited understanding of the movie.A Man is attacked by three younger men. The attack is vicious and the first man is robbed and left for dead. He somehow staggers to the hospital where he is thought lost and left by the medical staff only to jump up and leave the place. He is robbed of his boots whilst prone by water but luck has him taken in by people that care for him rather than misuse him. He as he slowly recovers has lost his memory and therefore spends the rest of the film unable to do more than survive via the relative kindness of others.Two youngsters and their mother. A Male friend of hers too. Blind Lemon Jefferson on the sound track and other songs provide clues to the Mystery Man's love of music.The attacked man finds accommodation (at a price) essentially a container. Salvation Army personnel help him and others. And one female Salvation Army officer particular become part of his life. He starts to help the Army in their work.He adds modern or fairly modern songs to the Salvation Army's musical quartet's reportoir and a female Salvation Army leader becomes their singer. He stumbles on the fact that he may have been a welder of some skill. He has already proved he can organise and is gifted a dog. Hannibal.On a visit to the bank - it is robbed and he and a female teller are locked in a vault. The police now take an interest in this mystery man and his identity is sought via the Press.The lawyer that springs him is quite a funny turn. I have never heard a Finnish accent like that gentleman's. Almost undecipherable to me at least. The bank robber later finds him and yields up his ill gotten gains before I assume killing himself Our mystery man spread tht money around his acquaintances and later in the film we find out what part of it was for. His identity is found and he travels to meet the wife he had forgotten who was divorcing him at the time he went missing and that was now complete.It allowed both of them to continue leading their new lives. Another man for the ex-wife and Salvation Army lady for our former Mystery Man.On the way back to Helsinki the three attackers from the start of the film are encountered again but this time he is not alone. The bad men's fates are left to our imagination but I suspect the police were not troubled till later. The man and his new love exit across a railway track.,"comedy, boring, dramatic, violence, atmospheric, revenge",train,imdb

The more the moles become involved in their undercover lives, the more issues they have to cope with.The Prologue opens with the introduction of Hon Sam (Eric Tsang Chi-Wai), a Triad boss and the primary antagonist of the film. Sam is sending a number of young, green gangsters to the police academy as molesamongst them is one called Lau Kin-Ming (whose younger version is portrayed by Edison Chen Koon-Hei).

Yan's undercover job becomes stressful while Ming quickly climbs the ladder in the police department.The film begins after Yan and Ming converse at a hi-fi store where Yan works, neither of them knowing who the other is. Soon after, Yan attends a funeral. It is revealed that Yip has recently died and that Superintendent Wong remains as the only person who could identify Yan as a cop. Later a deal between Hon Sam and a Thai cocaine dealer is interrupted by Superintendent Wong and his team due to Yan's tip-off using Morse Code. However, Ming alerted Sam of the bust with enough time for Sam to order his minions Tsui Wai-Keung (Chapman To Man-Chat) and Del Piero (Dion Lam Dik-On) to dispose of the cocaine so the police would not have any real evidence on the drug deal. Now, both Wong and Sam realize that they each have a mole within their respective organizations, putting them in a race against time to root out the other mole.Later, Sam converses with Ming at a cinema with Yan watching. As Sam and Ming leave, Yan tries to follow Ming. At the crucial moment, Yan's phone rings and he is forced to back off, thus losing his chance to capture Ming.At the same time, Yan and Ming are both struggling with their double identities. Yan is starting to lose faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; while Ming, on the other hand, becomes more and more used to the life of a righteous police officer and wants to erase his criminal background.Yan meets SP Wong a second time on the same rooftop unaware that Ming has his subordinate, CIB Inspector B (Gordon Lam Ka-Tung) and his team tracking him down. Sam, after getting intel from Ming, sends Keung, Del Piero and a gang of henchmen to confront them. Inspector B informs Ming and he sends an OCTB squad to attempt to save Wong. Yan eventually escapes the building by taking the crane but Wong is caught by Del Piero and is thrown off the roof. As Yan is about to escape, he witnesses Wong's fall to death, and is stunned. As the police close in, a shootout between the police and Triads breaks out, resulting in the death of 3 Triads, one of whom is Del Piero. In the aftermath of the gunfight, the OCTB squad arrives with Ming and Wong's second-in-command Inspector Cheung (Berg Ng Ting-Yip) on the scene, but they are too late to save Wong. Yan and Keung manage to escape from the gunfight. As Keung drives away with Yan, he crashes the car, and finding that he is wounded from the gun battle, Keung dies in Yan's arms.Eventually, Ming retrieves Wong's old cellphone and makes contact with Yan.

With Yan's help, Sam's drug deal is interrupted and Sam is killed by Ming. Many of Sam's other gangsters are arrested. Everything seems to work according to the plan: Yan could now return to his true identity as a police officer and Ming has successfully erased his criminal connections by eradicating Sam and his gangs. However, back at the police station, Yan discovers Ming was the mole, and leaves immediately. Ming realizes what has happened, and erases Yan's identity from the police computer records. Yan spends an evening with his therapist Lee (Kelly Chen), whom he was falling in love with, and sends a compact disc to Ming which is inadvertently intercepted by his wife Mary (Sammi Cheng Sau-Man) with a recording that Sam kept between himself and Ming.

Inspector B reveals that he was also a mole for Sam. He asks Ming to watch out for him, since their boss is already dead.

The Jacket,2005,103,Drama,7.1,John Maybury,Tom Bleecker,Steven Mackintosh,Brad Renfro,Adrien Brody,Brendan Coyle,"\"The film opens with Adrien Brody as an active soldier in the Gulf War in 1991. His voiceover tells us he was 27 the first time he died. While on duty, a young boy ambushes him and he is shot in the head.We move forward a year and he is clearly a loner. We see him hitch-hiking along a snowy road. He encounters a broken-down pick up truck with a young mother (Kelly Lynch), clearly under of the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, and a young girl, about eight or ten years old.The mother is too strung out to know what's going on, stumbling around in the snow near the truck intermittently vomiting.The girl meanwhile, is happy to talk to Brody, who offers to try to fix the truck. The girl sees his army dog tags attached to his bag and asks what they are. He says they're dog tags with his name on them, so he won't get lost. The girl asks can she have them and he gives them to her.After tinkering around with the engine, he asks the girl to try the ignition and the truck starts. At this point, the mother comes to, and, in her stoned reverie, becomes enraged, deciding that Brody is some kind of pervert, despite the girls protestations that he fixed the truck. She bundles the girl into the car and they drive off.Brody continues to walk, and is later picked up by a man in a car some miles from the Canadian border.After a few minutes of driving, the car is pulled over by a policeman. We don't see what happens at this point in the narrative, but next thing we know, Brody is on trial for the murder of the cop, and cannot remember anything from the day in question apart from the mother and the young girl, who the authorities have been unable to trace.Brody is found guilty but insane and sent to an asylum run by Kris Kristofferson.Jennifer Jason Leigh also works in the asylum. We later see that she is attempting to offer occupational therapy for the disabled son of a friend, but her success is minimal. This takes place in her home, and is not information Brody is privy to.One night, Brody is pumped full of drugs by the staff, placed in a straight jacket and put in a mortuary drawer. Here, he experiences several, rapid-cut flash backs to his past, including the war and the incident with the policeman, but not enough to assist piecing together what happened.The next time they try to put him in the drawer, he feigns acquiescence to lull the staff into a false sense of his co-operation, but then assaults Kristofferson, striking him in the face and injuring his cheek.In his next session, he finds himself transported to outside a diner late on Christmas Eve. Keira Knightley leaves work in the diner, pulls up and offers him a lift, explaining that he won't get a cab on Christmas Eve standing there.She takes him home and it is apparent that she drinks heavily and lives an isolated life. While she takes a bath, Brody rummages around in the fridge and ends up making them some toasted sandwiches.Knightley tells Brody that her mother died some years before, having passed out with a cigarette in her hand and subsequently burned to death.Looking around her place, Brody discovers his dog tags and asks her how she got them. Knightley becomes concerned when Brody tries to explain that they are his. Up to this point, we have no idea what year we are in, but a cursory glance at some bank statements reveals that Brody is now in 2007.Unable to explain to himself how this has happened, but completely convinced that he has somehow shot forward in time and met the grown-up girl, Brody tries to explain to Knightley who he is.Attempting to convince her by giving details about the day he met her and her mother with the pick-up truck (information which, as he says, there's no way he could know by just looking at the dog tags), an incredulous Knightley is adamant that he can't be who he claims to be, as he died on January 1st, 1993 as a result of a head wound, although she has no further information on this.Already emotionally unstable, Knightley becomes hysterical and demands he leave.Brody does so, and wakes up, back in the drawer in 1992.Brody now needs to get into the drawer on a nightly basis, in order to piece together what's going to happen to him on January 1st, six days away.Returning to 2007, Knightley now believes him, and agrees to help him. Brody needs to find out what happened to him, so (in order to explain the uncanny similarity to his own self from fifteen years earlier) he poses as his own nephew, and visits Jennifer Jason Leigh with Knightley.During this visit, he learns of her use of electro-shock therapy on the boy she looked after, but they learn nothing of the circumstances in which he died.While at the hospital, Brody encounters a patient who had been an orderly there when he was undergoing the jacket/mortuary drawer treatment, and who is now suffering from dementia.Knightley and Brody have sex, but Knightley wakes up alone the next morning, Brody having been sucked back to 1992 by his removal from the drawer.During one of his episodes in the drawer, we see what happened the day the policeman was killed. Pulled over by the cop, the driver of the car shoots him. Brody gets out of the car, incredulous. As the cop slumps back in the snow, he fires a shot which strikes Brody by accident. The driver continues to fire at the cop, killing him. He then wipes his gun clean and throws it into the snow near the now unconscious Brody, before driving away. Brody is incriminated and sent to the asylum.On his next visit to the future, Brody confronts Kristofferson, now an old man, convinced that he knows what became of him on January 1st, 1993, but Kristofferson cannot help.Brody asks Knightley what her address was in 1992, i.e. when he met her as a child on the roadside, and she tells him. Driving away, Brody disappears from the back seat of Knightley's car and returns to 1992.Back in 1992, Brody manages to convince Jennifer Jason Leigh that he has seen the future by telling her that she told him she used electro-therapy on the young boy. She doesn't believe him, as she says that such practices would not be used on so young a patient, but he says that she will eventually come to realise that this is the only way to help the boy. Brody explains that the boy is effectively in a constant fit, and that Leigh just hasn't realised this yet.Due to her lack of success with the boy up to this point, she takes a chance on Brody's assertion as to the electro-therapy. She applies a very low-frequency, short burst to the boy, which has instant success.Now that she believes Brody, she agrees to his request to deliver a letter to Kelly Lynch. Leigh smuggles him out of the asylum to drive him out to Keira Knightley's childhood home (i.e. where she lived in 1992/1993).Arriving at the house, the girl recognises him from the day he fixed the truck. He asks to speak to her mother.Having already learned that Kelly Lynch will pass out one day with a cigarette in her hand, and burn to death from the resulting fire, Brody gives her a letter warning her of this.Returning to the asylum with Jennifer Jason Leigh that evening, Brody slips on ice and hits his head, causing his fatal head wound. Asylum staff place him into the drawer before he dies, allowing him to return to 2007.As he is standing outside the diner, Knightley pulls up in a VW Beetle and offers him a lift (we assume that she recognises him, although in the altered future he would not have explained to her how he is to be there, completely unaged 14 years from the last time they met (all the previous experiences never happened for Knightley after Brody handed her mother the letter)). As they are driving away, Knightley's mother calls her on the phone. In this altered future, having (we assume) been convinced by Brody to believe the contents of the letter, Lynch (presumably) has cleaned up her act, so that in the improved 2007, she is still alive and it is apparent that she has a strong relationship with her (no longer dysfunctional) daughter.Knightley asks Brody \"\"how long do we have?\"\"","and they drive off together to the strains of \"\"We Have All The Time In The World\"\".\"","romantic, alternate history, murder",train

While working the nearly-empty barroom one night, an elderly guest invites him to take a break, smoke a cigar, and have a drink. Jean eventually falls asleep on the barroom sofa.Irene (Audrey Tautou), is a beautiful young woman who has made quite a career of gold-digging. She seduces rich and lonely gentlemen, which results in them footing expensive bills for her clothes, food, and board. Her current beau, the much-older Jacques , is staying in a suite with her at the hotel and promises to take her out on the night of her birthday. However, he drinks too much and falls asleep before he can keep his promise. Irene glumly visits the bar alone and finds no one in it but the sleeping Jean. Noticing his tuxedo (not realizing it is merely his uniform), Irene assumes he is wealthy hotel guest and awakens him. She chats him up casually, revealing it is her birthday, and that she would kill for a cocktail and some music. To cheer her up, Jacques mixes her a champagne cocktail, but does not reveal that he works at the hotel. Several drinks later, Irene asks his room number and he takes her to an empty suite on the fifth floor. They spend the night, and Irene leaves in the morning.A year later, Jean is surprised to see Irene return to the hotel, still with Jacques. In the dining room, Jean spies Jacques giving Irene an engagement ring which she accepts with enthusiasm. She encounters Jean again, remembering him from the year before. They again meet for drinks and end up in bed. Irene wakes in the morning and rushes back to her suite, realizing she had neglected Jacques for the entire evening. He angrily confronts her, as he had seen her kissing Jean in the bar the night before. He breaks the engagement, and Irene is left desperate for financial support. She returns to the suite, relieved that Jean is still there, and flatters Jean by claiming that she chose him over Jacques. Secure for the moment, Irene settles in. They are mortified the next morning when they are awakened by a hotel employee showing the supposedly vacant suite to a family. Jean is recognized by the employee, and Irene realizes he is not wealthy after all. Frustrated, she takes off.Irene spends the day at the park, calling a long list of rich men she had met over the years and hoping to find financial security again. She finds that many of the men are now married, dead, or otherwise involved and cannot help her. At the end of the day, she finally snares a dinner date with a possible new suitor (the grandson of a deceased former beau). At the restaurant that night, Irene encounters Jean who humbly apologizes for the events of that morning. Irene is still miffed over her miscalculation of his wealth, and rebuffs his invitation to dinner. Her date, Francois, arrives but is soon made uncomfortable by Jean's lingering presence and departs. With no other choice, Irene goes to dinner with Jean.Irene insists they eat at a very expensive restaurant, where she orders pricey champagne, lobster, and caviar (which she does not even like, but is attempting to develop a taste for). Floored by the bill but desperate for Irene's attention, Jean frantically calls his banker and has extra funds moved to his account. He continues to pursue Irene, using his limited cash to fuel her shopping habits. When he is nearly broke, she prepares to move on to a richer man. He uses his last euro to pay for ten more seconds of Irene's company. Now alone and in debt, Jean is noticed by an older female hotel guest. He soon finds himself in the same position as Irene. The woman, Madeline, allows him to stay in her suite and buys him expensive clothes in exchange for his company and attention. Jean encounters Irene again, and they form a legitimate friendship over their shared careers as gold-diggers. Irene provides Jean with tips and tricks to keep his patron interested and the cash flowing. She has moved on to another wealthy man and is staying in the same hotel as Jean. After Madeline forces Jean to have plastic surgery on his ear, Jean uses Irene's advice and sulks, resulting in Madeline buying him a scooter and an extravagant watch.Irene begins to develop a deeper attraction to Jean, and sneaks out of her suite one night to accompany Jean on a trip to the beach before she leaves for Venice with her new suitor, Gilles. She attempts to say goodbye to Jean, but they are spotted kissing on the balcony by Gilles, who leaves her and takes all her belongings. Irene is presented with this news while lounging at the pool, and now has nothing except the swimsuit and sarong she is currently wearing. Jean sells his valuable watch and buys Irene a new dress, an invitation to an exclusive party, and a week's stay at the hotel. Jean soothes Madeline (who was angered that he had sold the watch) by presenting her with diamond earrings he had also bought with the money.Irene spots her ex-benefactor, Jacques, at the party with another young woman, Agnes. She persuades Jean to help her win him back. Jean pretends to be a wealthy prince, and both attracts Agnes and drives away Madeline. He takes Agnes to his room while Irene sits with Jacques on a balcony across the way, hoping he will see Agnes kissing another man on Jean's balcony. However, Irene herself becomes jealous and leaves Jacques, racing to Jean's apartment to express her feelings. She tells Agnes the truth, that Jean is not wealthy, causing Agnes to leave in disgust.

The brothers' unrepentant mischief making causes their constant eviction from one foster home to the next. This prologue is narrated by magician Ricky Jay, foreshadowing the film's later focus on card tricks and sleight of hand.After 38 different foster families, the brothers are transferred to a close-knit small town filled with friendly children their age. Bloom begins to long for the comfort of a normal and honest social life, and develops a crush on one of the girls there, although he is too shy to approach anyone, and therefore keeps his feelings inside. Stephen notices this however, and realizes he can use his brother's interest in the children to create a role for his brother to play so he may befriend the children, and help them execute their first con.Stephen has Bloom convince his new friends that a mysterious old hermit told him of a cave that contains a magical whippoorwill. The hermit, Bloom claims, will reveal the location of the cave for $30. The children believe the story, he collects $30 among the group members, and they venture out to the cave.

At a party celebrating the successful end of it, Stephen celebrates as Bloom wanders into a quiet room contemplating his dishonest life, one that seems to lack substance. He is playing solitaire when a young woman named Ruth arrives and begins flirting with him. Bloom explains that the reason he and Stephen's cons work so well is because they include symbolic themes and hidden associations, which trick the mind into recalling old memories, which the brothers use to their advantage.

In order to get Tris off her back, Norah says that she isnt alone and that she really should be headed back to her boyfriend. Tris is taken aback by this and asks her where her boyfriend is. Norah just walks away to the bar where she spots Nick; she quietly asks him to be her boyfriend for five minutes and plants a kiss on him. They both enjoy it until Tris rushes over and asks how they both met, Norah covers up by saying they met at a dentist and have been dating ever since. Tris is obviously jealous but ends up leaving with Gary, Norah decides that Caroline is again too drunk to handle and attempts to get her home. Nicks friends Dev and Thom see this and try to stall; they obviously hate Tris and think Norah would be perfect for their friend. Dev, Thom, and Thoms date Beefy Guy end up offering Caroline a ride home in their van so Nick and Norah could stay in the city and search for the band Wheres Fluffy?.Nick and Norah are both hesitant but ultimately agree. Nick tells Norah that Dev, Thom, and the beefy guy are all gay so if anyone gets raped in the van it would be a guy and not Caroline. Before the group splits up, Thom talks to Nick and convinces him to give Norah a shot since they obviously mesh great together. Dev takes Norah to the van and gives her a push-up bra to replace her sports one.Nick and Norah head off around the East Village trying to find Wheres Fluffy? Norah teases him about his Yugo and they both talk about how much they love the band and playfully argue about whom loved them first. A drunken couple blag their way into Nick's yellow Yugo, thinking it's a cab. They ask him to drop them off at Bowery Ballroom and proceed to make a drunken spectacle fooling around in the back seat. Nick let's them off at their destination and Norah continues to tease him playfully. Nick ultimately ruins it by bringing up Tris and asking Norah if she is the friend Tris claimed was always jealous of her. Norah gets out of the car and is about to get a taxi when Nick calls her back saying his friends had lost Caroline. Caroline had jumped out of the van after hearing the boys discuss band new band names like Balls Deep. Now no one knows where Caroline is so they all decide to meet up and try to find her. They scour the city looking for her; Caroline is shown in Port Authority terminal trying to get a ticket back home to Jersey, since she doesnt have any money she is pretty much stuck. Caroline end up having a drunken one-sided conversation with a guy dressed as a chef, she ultimately tries to eat half of his sandwich but ends up running to the bathroom and throwing up. Nick, Norah and the gang all show up at Port Authority and realize that the last bus to Jersey had already left, they assume that Caroline must be wherever Wheres Fluffy? is and they leave to go look for her. As they leave, Caroline is seen stumbling out of bathroom.Nick, Norah, and the rest of the gang end up at BK Pool, a club in Brooklyn. Norah can easily get into club and Nick asks why, but they're both interrupted by Tal (Jay Baruchel). Tal is Norahs ex, he proceeds to drag Norah away and kiss her neck. Nick is obviously jealous at this and steals glances at Norah every now and then. Ultimately, it turns out to be the old bait and switch routine and instead of Wheres Fluff? its a band called Are you randy? Everyone ends up leaving and Nick is surprised to see Norah walk back with them to the van, he ends up giving her his sweater to keep her warm. As they head back to the city they run into Tris again in a convenience store, inside Tris confronts Norah and tries to convince her that Nick isnt the guy for her. When that doesnt work, Tris teases her about the fact that she has never had an orgasm and never will have one with Nick. Tris ends up receiving a call from Caroline, apparently Caroline has found Jesus and Norah ends up rushing out to try and find her. Norah tells the guys the new information and they all scour churches trying to find Caroline. In one particular scene, Nick runs into a group of threatening homeless people including Andy Sandberg (SNL) in front of a church and ends up running away. Eventually, Thom and Dev remember a gay cabaret show with a Christmas theme; they all head there and find Caroline in the show dressed up as a lighted Christmas tree.On their way back to Nicks car, Nick realizes what a good friend Norah is by taking care of Caroline in her drunken state. In a sweet scene, he ends up using a saved wet-nap to clean Norahs hand after Caroline throws up on her. When they reach his car, Tris is found sitting on it. Nick leaves to confront her and basically forgets about Norah, Norah stops him and shyly whispers that it was nice meeting him as his friends lament Nick leaving her.Norah decides to call up her ex and meet up with him at Crash Mansion. Once there, she realizes that Tal is only using her for connections. Norah's Dad is famous music producer and that explains why Norah can walk into any club without being stopped. Norah eventually gets frustrated after being asked to take care of a bar tab, she tells the waitress she miscalculated the bill and to add an extra zero, she ends up storming out of the club.In the meantime, Tris tells Nick that she wants a ride home from someone dependable like him, on the way to Jersey she says that was wrong and that she wants him back. She convinces him to pull over on the Westside Highway by Pier 54 to seduce him and dances sexily to You Sexy Thing. As she dances, Nick remembers the fun he had with Norah; he ends up driving away and leaving Tris still dancing. Nick calls up Norah to apologize and asks to meet with her. Norah is eating pierogi at Veselka, and she tells him to meet her on 2nd Ave and 10th St. There Nick apologizes again and they both agree to go someplace where they know no one will find them.

Nick is amazed by where they are and all of the equipment, Norah asks him to record something and he steps into the booth and sings a little song about how she crashed his car. Norah ends up walking into the booth with him, they stare at each other before making out on the couch, the sound equipment then picks up Norah having an orgasm inside the booth, courtesy of Nick.

Both want to know why they were ditched, Tal ends up pulling Norah away from Nick again, Nick pushes him and a fight is about to start but the Beefy Guy/ Lothario ends up head butting Tal.

They are then both seen entering Penn Station, Norah is curious if Nick regrets not watching the show and asks if he minds missing it all, Nick who doesn't care about the show answers her back instead about their connection, saying this is it and they share a kiss as they go down the escalator.","romantic, cute",train,imdb
Donkey Punch,2008,99,Drama,5.2,Olly Blackburn,Olly Blackburn,Julian Morris,Tom Burke,Robert Boulter,Jay Taylor,"The movie begins with seaside views of Mallorca, Spain. In a hotel bathroom is Tammi (Nichola Burley) face-up in the bathtub. She gets up from the tub and starts to shave her armpits when she accidentally cuts herself. Her friends Lisa (Sian Breckin) and Kim (Jaime Winstone) come in and Lisa tells her that shes gorgeous; Tammi says no, shes a mess.They leave the bathroom and sit on the beds and Kim tells them that theyre going to love the place that theyre going to. Tammi gets a text message on her phone but Lisa takes it before Tammi could get to it. Lisa sees that its Ryan and Tammi immediately wants her phone back. Kim takes it from Lisa, and tells Tammi that hes toxic, sending Ryan a text reply, and gives the phone back to Tammi. Tammi sees that Kim wrote F*CK OFF 4EVR! to Ryan and laughs but Tammi tells Kim that she doesnt believe her. Lisa tells Tammi that she promised that she would have no contact with Ryan (who we should assume is Tammi's ex), and she pours them all vodka, toasting to Tammi for being brave and for their upcoming fun weekend together.As some credits roll, we see the three girls getting into a taxi and going to various bars, drinking, having fun, and flirting with a bunch of guys. At one place, they meet a group of guys. One of them asks what theyre drinking, and Kim answers champagne. He says hes paying and says his name is Marcus (Jay Taylor) and the collective group of Marcus and his friends and Kim and her friends end up stealing a bottle of champagne and taking it out with them.While sitting at a beach, Tammi and Lisa are talking and they cant believe that they were just at rainy Leeds and now theyre in sunny Mallorca. The three girls are hanging out on the beach with the guys when Kim asks what they all want to do next. Her friends dont want to go to another bar so one of the guys tell them that theyre welcome to hangout in their yacht. The girls learn that the guys are crewmen, not owners of the yacht. Lisa agrees for all of them and they make their way to the boat.On the dock, Lisa and Kim are excited, laughing with the boys and having fun. However, Tammi is obviously not sure about going with the boys and she overhears one guy telling the other guys that everythings going according to plan. Before they all get on, Tammi tells her friends that she might just go back to the hotel since she thought that it was supposed to be just the three of them for the weekend. Kim is fine with catching up with Tammi later, but Lisa tries to talk Tammi out of it and to just come on the boat for a drink.The guys call out to a guy on the boat named Sean, the boats engineer, and Lisa convinces Tammi to get on the boat. Kim learns that Sean and Josh are brothers. The girls see how large the boats downstairs area is and Josh gives them a tour of the boat and shows them the different bedrooms as well as the engine room.While Josh is giving the girls a tour, the guys talk about who theyre going to have. Bluey (Tom Burke) calls dibs on Kim, while Marcus gets Lisa, meaning that either Josh or his brother Sean get Tammi. The group party upstairs and Kim tries to make the music louder. However, Sean tells the group that they cant have the music too loud on the dock or theyll get in trouble. Kim says theyre going to leave, and the guys then suggest that they have their party on the high seas. Sean reluctantly agrees. Tammi is outside and Sean comes and flirts with her, teaching her how to unwind the rope tying the boat to the dock.Bluey comes up on deck and gives them all ecstasy pills. They all take a whole pill except for Tammi and Sean who each take a half. They anchor out and they swim in the ocean except for Bluey. They start talking about sex positions like Dirty Sanchez and Turkey when Bluey asks the group if theyve heard of a Donkey Punch. Marcus claims to have done it before and Bluey explains what it is (during anal sex, punching the back of the girls head at the right time to get a better orgasm). Meanwhile, Tammi is in the water with Sean and she talks about not wanting to go back to Leeds because there are people there she doesnt want to see anymore.Later on, Bluey has some smoking paraphernalia and claims that his drug is hardcore, in which Lisa answers that she is hardcore so she takes a hit and so does Kim. Bluey also gives Josh a hit. Kim, Bluey, Marcus, and Lisa go downstairs and start making out in the master bedroom when Josh comes down to watch. Bluey takes out a video camera and starts taping Lisa and Kim making out. Kim tries to get the guys to makeout but instead the guys have a competition on who has the best butt.Up on deck, Sean and Tammi are talking about their most recent past relationships. Seans being that the girl messed around with him and Tammis ex cheated on her with a close friend of hers. Tammi gets up to put some music on when she realizes that everyone else had gone downstairs. When she tells Sean that even Josh is gone, Sean is worried for a bit and is about to go downstairs but then Tammi starts making out with him.Meanwhile downstairs, Kim starts making out with Marcus even though shes really supposed to be with Bluey so Lisa takes Bluey and they all have sex in the master bedroom with Josh still watching them and videotaping the whole scenario. Then Bluey gets Lisa to let Josh have a go at her. Lisa and Josh are having sex doggie style with Bluey videotaping them and coaching Josh on when Bluey refers back to the Donkey Punch and tells Josh to do it, so Josh punches Lisa at the back of her head and she falls down.There is obviously something wrong and Kim and Marcus stop what theyre doing. Josh leaves the room in a hurry and Marcus goes out on the deck to tell Sean to come inside. Downstairs, Kim is huddled on the couch and we see Marcus checking for Lisas pulse. Sean comes in and checks her pulse and says he thinks shes dead. When the girls asked what happened, Bluey doesnt respond and Sean says that she must have overdosed. The girls leave the room and Sean says that hell alert the Coast Guard. However, Josh says that they shouldnt as there would be no point and they would be gone by the time they got there. Sean suspects that something else went on.Downstairs, Bluey and Josh talk about what just happened. Josh says that he didnt do anything but Bluey says he saw Josh. Marcus wants to know what really happened and Bluey tells Marcus that Josh donkey punched Lisa, but Josh starts to say that Bluey told him to, but Bluey denies it. Bluey tells Josh that the Donkey Punch is just a story and no one actually does it. Marcus cannot believe that it happened so Bluey shows him the videotape.Kim and Tammi are in another bedroom and Kim tells Tammi that she feels that Bluey and Josh are acting weird. Tammi asks, and Kim says that they were shouting and filming when Lisa died.Marcus finishes watching the tape and is angry at Josh for getting them all involved. The three boys go on deck to Sean and Marcus has Josh tell his brother what happened. Sean watches the tape and Josh asks Sean for his help. Marcus shuts off the yacht power and Marcus says that since theres a girl downstairs with a broken neck and that their DNA is all over her, theyre all going down for the crime. Josh suggests that they could say that she fell overboard.Downstairs, Kim and Tammi are freaking out because their cell phones dont have service.Upstairs, the guys continue talking about what they should do, as Sean points out that Kim and Tammi arent going to agree to lie about Lisa falling overboard. Bluey suggests that they dump the two girls as well which makes Sean freak out and say that its Blueys fault that this happened because he supplied the drugs and told the stories. Bluey says that Josh did it and Josh tells him to shut up and not to push his luck and surprisingly, Bluey listens to him. Bluey apparently throws the tape out into the sea. The guys continue talking about the situation and agree that they cant go to the police and get in trouble as well. Still Sean says that someone needs to tell the girls.Downstairs the guys sit the girls down and say that they should all do the right thing. When Tammi asks what that means, Marcus tells her that as far as the Coast Guard was concerned, Lisa fell overboard. Tammi says that theyre mental. Marcus asks the girls how long theyve known Lisa for, and if they want to be the ones to tell Lisas parents how she really died. Marcus says that he just wants whats best for everyone. Kim says that she knows that Josh killed Lisa, and that its all on tape. Josh denies there being a tape and Marcus says that a decision has been made. Marcus and Josh go to the master bedroom where Lisas body is covered in a bedsheet. Marcus lifts the sheet up and sees a dark bruise on the back of Lisas neck. Sean comes in and helps Marcus carry the body out when Josh points out that they have to be in international waters and Sean tells him to shut up. Marcus says that they need to do it now and while the girls are still scared. Up on deck Marcus gives Josh instructions to stop the boat and anchor. While theyre tying up Lisas body to be thrown overboard, Sean says that its not right but Marcus says that hes worked too hard to have his brother mess it all up and that this way everyone gets their lives back. Sean says Not everyoneDownstairs, a scuffle goes on between Kim and the guys. Bluey is holding Kim back and Josh is holding Tammi. Kim claims that shes going to tell the police, while Josh retorts that that would mean telling the police about the drugs that she did and how she was having sex with a stranger. Kim gets away from Blueys hold and takes a knife from the kitchen. She manages to get up on deck and points the knife at Marcus to stop them from throwing Lisa overboard. Marcus gets the knife away from Kim and Bluey comes to hold her as they dump Lisas body into the sea.","","",""

Grace,2009,85,Drama,5.2,Paul Solet,Paul Solet,Troy Skog,Serge Houde,Malcolm Stewart,Jeff Stone,"In the opening scene, a young couple named Michael and Madeline are having sex, attempting to conceive. It is soon apparent that they have succeeded.Michael's parents arrive for dinner: a vegan meal prepared by a now visibly pregnant Madeline. Michael's domineering mother Vivian grimaces at the food and suggests - in a passive aggressive fashion - that a more conventional diet would be healthier for the unborn baby. The conversation turns to the couple's unsuccessful search for a suitable obstetrician. Madeline has rejected Vivian's preferred doctor and friend, Dr. Sohn. Instead she has decided to consult Patricia, her old friend and midwife at an independent clinic. Vivian does not hide her disapproval. Though Michael is also skeptical, the couple visit the clinic for a tour. They meet with Patricia, who describes her natural approach to birthing. Madeline reveals that she and Michael have conceived twice before, but both pregnancies were unsuccessful.One night, Michael rushes Madeline to the hospital because of chest pain. Dr. Sohn arrives at Vivian's request. Just before he administers drugs to induce labor, Patricia arrives. She challenges his diagnosis and determines through blood work (which he has ignored) that inducement is not necessary. Madeline is treated and later released. On the way home from the hospital, a car accident kills both Michael and the unborn baby.Madeline refuses to go to the hospital to have the dead fetus removed. Patricia allows Madeline to carry the dead fetus to term and some weeks later the baby is delivered in Patricia's birthing tub. Madeline is left alone with the stillborn baby and pleads for her to live. Patricia returns to reason with Madeline, to find the baby miraculously alive. Overjoyed, Madeline names the baby Grace.Patricia later visits Madeline at home. She encourages Madeline to take Grace to the hospital for tests to help understand how she revived. Citing her recent experience with Dr. Sohn, Madeline refuses any involvement with conventional medicine. When Patricia reaches out to stroke Madeline's face, Madeline rebuffs her. Patricia leaves, visibly upset.As Madeline cares for the infant Grace, she tries to ignore strange happenings that occur. She resorts to hanging fly paper in the nursery because Grace is attracting them. She is unable to rid the house of a putrid smell and soon realizes that Grace is the source, though her diaper is not soiled. She decides to bathe her, but Grace's skin begins to bleed in the warm bath water.

She visits Dr. Sohn and convinces him to visit Madeline while looking to collect proof that she is an unfit mother. She intends to have Madeline arrested and raise Grace herself.Madeline discovers that Grace's nursing is painful to the point of causing her breast to bleed. She soon realizes that the undead child is actually feeding on her blood. She buys raw beef, drains the blood, and is able to get Grace to drink it from a bottle. While disposing of the leftover meat outside, she almost catches Patricia spying on her from her car. She returns indoors to find Grace vomiting up the cow's blood, leaving Madeline no choice but to continue to feed Grace from her own bleeding breast. Each feeding becomes more gruesome and Madeline begins to become dangerously weak.Madeline becomes so sick and distraught that she allows Dr. Sohn into her home when he calls on her. He examines her, explains that she is anemic, and instructs her to refrain from nursing for a few days. After hearing Grace cry weakly, he starts upstairs, while dialing Vivian's number on his cell phone. Fearing that he will take Grace away from her, Madeline beats Dr. Sohn unconscious, but not before his call connects.Vivian arrives just as Madeline finishes draining blood from Dr. Sohn's arm into a baby bottle. Vivian notices the unkempt state of the house and suspiciously remarks at Madeline's sick appearance. She agrees to leave, but instead sneaks upstairs.

While seeking a place to hide, she discovers Dr. Sohn's body. She arms herself with a hammer she brought along and sneaks down the stairs with Grace. Madeline confronts her, and the two fight. Vivian beats Madeline unconscious with the hammer, but not before Madeline rips out part of her throat with her teeth. They are discovered by Patricia, who realized her girlfriend was withholding Madeline's messages and decided to investigate.Some time later, Patricia is driving a motor home through the desert. She pulls over and goes to the back to check on a very-much alive Madeline and Grace. Both women have changed their hair or donned wigs.

There is a high school football game where Matt Eckert's (Josh Peck) team loses because he gets cocky and keeps trying to run the ball in, even though he should be making more passes as the quarterback, like the coach tells him to.After the game, he gets picked up by his girlfriend, Erica (Isabel Lucas), who's one of the cheerleaders in the school, and they go off to a party that night.

Matt arrives home and asks his dad whether he saw the game, to which he proudly replies that the team is lucky to have him regardless of the outcome. Tom is a police officer within Spokane and he needs to leave in order to investigate the power outage. Matt walks up the porch, sees Jed, and walks into the house without saying a word to him.The next morning, Matt and Jed wake up to the rumbling sounds around them. Items around their house start to fall over, and they run outside to find out whats going on. They look up and see dozens of large aircraft with soldiers parachuting from them. One plane gets shot down by a ground-to-air missile and crashes into a nearby house.The brothers get into their pickup truck and drive off to find their dad, who meets them along the way as he was driving towards them as well to regroup. They follow him towards the direction of the town outskirts as a descending paratrooper fires at them, but the Eckerts manage to run him over. Tom tells his sons to drive away to their cabin in the mountains for safety as he stays behind to help the rest of the townspeople. Reluctant at first, they soon comply and speed off.We get our first detailed glimpses of the invading troops and realize they are North Koreans as they wear the symbol of the North Korean military. The Eckert brothers are pursued by other North Korean military vehicles that spot them as they try to save Erica before she is captured, but it is too late. Reversing direction, they manage to pick up a few more people, including schoolmates Robert (Josh Hutcherson) and Daryl (Connor Cruise), as some other escapees follow them in another car. They get to the cabin and try to compile as many supplies as they can. At night, they see a vehicle driving by, and Jed takes point with a rifle in case its a hostile. It turns out to be a non-military vehicle, but Pete (Steve Lenz) fires a wild shot at it with a handgun he found earlier, almost hitting Jed in the process. Jed orders him to hand the weapon over, but Pete refuses, so Jed takes it by force.The following morning, they find out Pete left with all their food, so they gather what they can and leave the cabin. They scout around, but hear some sounds and see that a North Korean officer named Captain Cho (Will Yun Lee) is at their cabin with some soldiers and uses Tom and Daryl's fathers as bait to draw them out from the woods. Pete had betrayed them and gave away their location. Although Daryl's father is more compliant, Tom tells his sons through the megaphone to kill the bastard, pointing at Cho, and is shot by him as the soldiers burn down the cabin.After a moment of mourning, Jed gives a speech about how this is their home, and the group decides to sow chaos among the invaders with guerrilla tactics, and learn how to operate the various weapons they could gather.On their first raid, Toni (Adrianne Palicki) is sent as bait. She approaches a checkpoint and suddenly turns to run away, prompting several soldiers to chase her around a corner where she immediately ducks as the rest of the group rise from their cover and shoot down the soldiers. They then strip all their weapons and gear to take with them back to their new makeshift base in the woods.Over the course of the next few days, they cause more chaos among the invaders by using stolen C4 and other explosives to blow up various military checkpoints, and outright shooting down other ground soldiers from rooftops with their captured small arms. They exclaim themselves to be the Wolverines, based on their school mascot, and the word spreads, causing others to rise up against their invaders.At one outdoor public gathering where North Korean officials are speaking to the remaining people of the town, along with collaborators (Americans who have chosen to work with the invaders to spare their own lives) and a few allied Chinese and Russian military personnel, the Wolverines are preparing to take them out with live fire and explosives. However, Matt sees Erica, who is a prisoner at this point, being transported away in a school bus and sets off the explosions early. He is able to free her, and they escape within the chaos, but one of the other Wolverines is gunned down.Jed is angry at Matt for disobeying and risking all their lives. Matt runs off, but after a few days, Jed goes to have a brotherly talk with Matt, where Matt accuses Jed of disappearing for six years when their mother died, leaving him and his father who too out his frustration by physically beating Matt. Jed admits he was wrong to do so since he was emotionally lost and needed to find himself, but that he needs him now, and they eventually reconcile and return to the group.Meanwhile in Spokane, a high-ranking North Korean military officer barges into Cho's office, furious at him for being unable to stop the Wolverines, but Cho says he has a plan.As the Wolverines rest up in their hideout, their shelter is suddenly destroyed when enemy jets bomb a large area of the woods. Two more are killed, and they go on the run. Only Matt, Jed, Toni, Erica, Robert, and Daryl are left. In the woods, they meet three American military personnel, led by Tanner (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who coincidentally have been looking for the Wolverines.Over a campfire, they realize that both groups had independently come up with the conclusion that the briefcase that Cho always carries with him is crucial to the invaders and must be captured. They go ahead with a raid on the local police station which the enemy personnel within the district have utilized as their base and manage to take down many of the soldiers. As Daryl is running away, he is caught and stabbed by some enemy Russian associates, but manages to escape. Meanwhile, Jed fights Cho, and they eventually end up in his fathers office inside the station. Cho gets the upper hand as Jed ducks under his father's desk, but he pulls out a gun from a hidden compartment to shoot Cho in the legs, causing him to collapse. Jed then finishes off Cho. Matt manages to retrieve the dropped briefcase from a fallen soldier, and he rejoins Jed to make a run for it.They get away and hide out in a broken down house somewhere for shelter. Jed is proud of Matt, stating that he was never good at giving props to his brother, but that he deserved it this time. He gives his brother a beer, to which Matt replies it would be his first one, and they laugh. Jed then gets up to walk over to Toni, who is smiling at him in the hallway with another beer in hand, when he is suddenly shot and killed. The invaders had found their location and begin firing upon them. Matt yells for everyone to get out, and they manage to do so, getting into a car and speeding off.They stop briefly in the woods to rethink their situation, and figure out that the enemy soldiers were able to find them because of a tracking device that has been embedded in Daryl's side. During the earlier battle, the Russians had actually embedded a tracker into him and allowed him to escape so that he would lead them straight to the rest of the group. Knowing it can't be removed, Daryl decides to stay behind with only a rifle as the others drive off.The next scene shows other American military personnel and the four remaining Wolverines in a field as they load the briefcase onto a helicopter and prepare to take off. Tanner offers the surviving Wolverines the chance to go with them, away from the battle zone, but Matt refuses. The Wolverines decide to stay.The final scene shows Matt atop a car, giving the same speech his brother gave to them near the beginning to more individuals wanting to fight against the invaders. That night, they storm the detention center where the invaders are keeping prisoners. The Wolverines attack with heavily armed jeeps and vehicles as people start shouting the name, and the last shot shows many of the resistance running forward with an American flag fluttering in the wind among them.","revenge, murder, violence",train,imdb

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,2013,146,Action,7.5,Francis Lawrence,Simon Beaufoy,Josh Hutcherson,Woody Harrelson,Philip Seymour Hoffman,Jack Quaid,"Six months after winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have resumed their life in the coal mining town in District 12. As part of their victory, they now have a luxurious house in the so-called Victor's Village, where Katniss lives with her mother and sister. On the day Katniss and Peeta are set to begin a victory tour of the country, President Coriolanus Snow visits her. He explains that her approach to ending the last Hunger Games, where she and Peeta attempted a suicide pact after learning they could not both survive, inspired rebellions in the districts. He orders that Katniss not only convince the entire country of her and Peeta's love as the reason for their actions, but convince Snow himself as well; if not, her loved ones will be killed, and District 12 will be destroyed, just as District 13 was during the uprising years ago.The first stop of the tour is in District 11, former home of Rue, Katniss' 12-year-old ally who was killed in the previous games. After Katniss and Peeta voice their personal thoughts regarding both the districts' fallen tributes, a man in the crowd whistles the tune Katniss and Rue shared to ensure each another of their safety, and makes the three-finger salute of District 12. Everyone follows the man's example until a Peacekeeper shoots the man dead, leaving Katniss angry, afraid, and upset. Their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, informs Katniss and Peeta that they must display their relationship for the remainder of their lives.Katniss proposes a public engagement between herself and Peeta, which is carried out and celebrated at Snow's home in the Capitol. There, Katniss meets with the new Game-maker, Plutarch Heavensbee, who has specifically requested the position, in spite of his predecessor, Seneca Crane, ending up dead due to his inability to control the ending of the previous Hunger Games. Upon returning to District 12, Katniss warns her close friend, Gale Hawthorne, of President Snow's threat to kill both their families.In the meanwhile, Heavensbee assists President Snow in his efforts to quell the uprising in the District. His strategy is to taint Katniss' public image, in an attempt to destroy her as symbol for the uprising. To that end, Peacekeepers crack down in District 12, causing Gale to be publicly whipped after attacking newly placed Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. However, Katniss and Haymitch intervene, making them even stronger advocates for rebellion. That evening, Snow devises a different strategy; if Katniss refuses to play by his rules, he will get rid of her by other means. He announces Panem's third Quarter Quell, a version of the Hunger Games every 25 years that contains a special provision: all tributes are selected from the existing pool of victors. Since Katniss is the only surviving female victor of District 12, this means she is a tribute by default. She immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta becomes the Quarter Quell's victor, should he compete in the games.At the reaping, Katniss and Haymitch are reaped by chaperon Effie Trinket. However, Peeta volunteers to take Haymitch's place and is sent directly to the train with Katniss, without a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones. This also cancels their wedding, which was supposed to take place the next day.Katniss and Peeta are taken to the capital city, ride the parade again and are forced into training. They meet their fellow victors from the other Districts. The two of them are immediately wanted as allies by the majority of the tributes, although some of them are old, weak or ill-suited for the physical match. Still, she finds that some of them, while lacking in brute strength, may have valuable surviving skills. During their individual evaluations, Peeta creates a drawing of a deceased Rue covered in flowers on the floor; an emotion-stricken Katniss creates a puppet in the likeness of Seneca Crane, and suspends it by its neck on the ceiling, as a a warning to a stunned Heavensbee.During the personal interviews with Caesar Flickerman, Katniss wears a wedding dress (as ordered to by President Snow). As a special effect, her designer Cinna has designed it to turn into a costume resembling a Mockingjay, which has become a symbol of silent protest against the Capitol. When it is time for Peeta's interview, he reveals (falsely) that Katniss is pregnant, which incites an overwhelming reaction from the public to cancel the game; however, President Snow orders that the game proceed anyway.Before entering the arena, as the pedestal rises, Katniss witnesses Thread and his men entering the room and beating Cinna to death, in punishment over his controversial dress design for Katniss. Katniss is devastated, but unable to stop them. She ends up in the arena, which is a tropical forrest with a central salt water lake, with an island in the middle containing the Cornucopia.The games start in the usual chaotic way, with most tributes going for weapons at the Cornucopia, resulting in a lot of initial deaths. Katniss and Peeta manage to survive the first wave of killings, and hide inside the forrest. Snow hopes that Katniss will kill and betray as many other tributes as possible to stay alive, and thereby make herself unpopular. However, as the games get underway, Katniss and Peeta ally with Finnick Odair and Mags, both from District 4. They find that the arena is a dome protected by electrical orcefields; Peeta nearly dies after hitting the field, but is resussitated by Finnick. Later that night, they are attacked by a chemical weapon made up of a fog of painful poisonous gas. Mags sacrifices herself early on, allowing the others to escape. The remaining trio rests in the middle of the forest where they are attacked by mandrills. During the attack the woman from District 6, a camouflage expert and drug addict, sacrifices her life for Peeta. After they escape the mandrills and rest at the beach, they are met by District 3's intelligent tributes, Wiress and Beetee, and District 7's female tribute, the cunning Johanna Mason.Johanna tells about how her group was surprised by a rain of blood, causing them to become blinded, and one tribute getting killed by an electric forcefield. The group subsequently witnesses a large flooding, killing an unknown tribute in one section on the other side of the jungle. Wiress discovers that the arena is designed like a clock and every hour a specific attack occurs in its designated section. The other group of tributes then launches a suprise attack, causing several deaths in both teams, including Wiress. Heavensbee causes the Cornucopia island to start spinning violently. The spinning causes the team to break apart. Finnick and Katniss make it to the jungle, to be subsequently lured into the woods by screams from their respective girlfriend and sister; however, it appears that they are fooled by jabberjays, genetically engineered birds that mimic the sounds of human voices. They re-group with the others.Beetee suggests a plan to electrocute the two remaining tributes outside the alliance, District 2's Brutus and Enobaria, by connecting a wire to a tree that is struck by lightning at noon and midnight each day. Beetee secures the wire to the tree, and Katniss and Johanna are required to take the other end back to the beach. The plan fails when the wire snaps, cut by Brutus and Enobaria, who are ready to kill Katniss. However, Johanna suddenly attacks Katniss, but cuts the tracker out of her arm and smears blood on her neck. With Katniss appearing dead, Johanna lures the other tributes away. After recovering enough to track down Peeta, Katniss finds the rest missing and Beetee unconscious. Finnick approaches and Katniss draws her bow, no longer knowing who she can trust, but hesitates to shoot. The storm clouds swirl and the lightning bolt starts to form. She quickly attaches the remaining wire to an arrow and shoots it at the force field during the lightning strike. This causes a massive blackout in the dome, and the arena to shut down. President Snow enters the game room demanding answers, only to find that the game is off the air and Heavensbee is gone.Due to the impact of the electric blast, Katniss is near unconsciousness, but witnesses the arena dome starting to crumble. In her last waking moment, she notices an aircraft entering and picking her up.She awakens in an aircraft with an unconscious Beetee. Upon entering the cockpit she finds Haymitch, Finnick and Plutarch Heavensbee, who reveals himself as an ally and a turncoat-rebel against Snow. Learning she is on her way to District 13, and Johanna and Peeta were taken away by the Capitol, she attempts to attack Haymitch for not fulfilling his promise of returning Peeta home safely. Plutarch sedates her and she awakens days later with Gale by her side, who informs that her family is safe but District 12 has been destroyed by a government airstrike.","realism, murder, violence, satire, romantic, sci-fi",test,imdb

Bing Bong starts a party in the classroom with balloons and confetti. He dances around and causes the dog costume to rip in half, and Joy chases Sadness around, causing the dream to be half a dog chasing the other half.

Joy acknowledges that Sadness had the right idea to scare Riley awake. Bing Bong finds a box of Riley's memories, and Sadness fixates on one where Riley is celebrating with her teammates.

Riley shoves her clothes into her backpack and leaves the house, pretending that she's going to school. Family Island starts to crumble, exposing a memory recall tube. Joy and Sadness realize that they could be sucked up and sent back to headquarters. Riley heads out for the bus station, causing Family Island to quake.Joy and Sadness make it to a tube, but Sadness can't get in without turning the core memories sad, and Joy decides to go back alone. The quake causes the tube to break apart, and Sadness watches helplessly as Bing Bong tries to save her, and they both fall into the abyss. Joy realizes that she's in the memory dump, and tries to climb out. Bing Bong finds her and tells her there's no point. Joy finds the sad core memory that never got stored at headquarters. Dejected, Joy goes through Riley's core memories. A tear falls on the memory where Riley is celebrating with her teammates. Wiping away the tear causes the memory to rewind, and Joy sees Riley, just after she had missed her shot, alone in a tree, looking sad. Moving forward, Joy sees Riley's parents console her, and her teammates lift her up on their shoulders. Joy realizes that Sadness had helped Riley by calling attention to her mood.With renewed determination, Joy finds Bing Bong's rocket ship, and sings its broom engines to life. They try several times, with the ship coming closer and closer to escaping.

The heart of pirate criminality has become Somalia since the collapse of the state over two decades ago. It emanates malignant danger and threat all over Indian Ocean and in this story the victims are a Danish cargo ship's crew.The chef Mikkel is the one who is facing the biggest pressure. Instead of the ship's engineer or the captain he was chosen as the one the negotiators use for initiating contact with Orion Subway's CEO Peter for ransom money. The negotiators want Mikkel to express desperation and genuine fear when asking for exorbitant sums for the lives of the crew and for returning the ship to its owners.And the game of chess begins. The tormenting conditions of the crew linger on for months. Peter is in need of resolution but weighs the accumulating traumas of his men against massive sums of money to be paid to the callous captors. Hostages are the pawns on the chessboard under constant threat of violence by psychopathic, impulsive, illiterate teens waving deadly weapons at their face. Only the negotiator speaks a common language with the crew, the youthful pirates entertain themselves by humiliating the Danes whenever in the mood. During the protracted process there are also better times when slight bonding happens under the duress of the Ocean, but the crew's status as an expensive and valuable merchandise whose state of expressed misery is measurable by the profits gained by the captors and the termination of the whole ordeal warrants occasional abuse.Peter remains firm and resolute, Mikkel's family is desperate and hostage to their circumstances as faraway collateral victims, and Mikkel has resigned to his fate as a commodity to be traded. He can't do much else. Nerves falter, poker faces won't hold and some chips end up snatched forever...","dramatic, suspenseful, mystery",train,imdb

Lucky Bastard,2014,94,Drama,4.4,Robert Nathan,Lukas Kendall,Clint Brink,Chris Wylde,Don McManus,Jay Paulson,"Darkness. Police explore a crime scene, a San Fernando Valley house. We view the footage of their crime scene video. They find bodies, one after another -- What the hell happened here?One week earlier. The same house. An attractive young woman sits on a couch. This is Casey (Catherine Annette). She is interviewed by Devin (Clint Brink), filming her for an adult video -- but Casey underestimated the appetite of Devin and his cohort Josh (Lee Kholafai) for violent sex. They are interrupted by another porn star, the savvy Ashley Saint (Betsy Rue), who tries to rescue Casey -- but is jumped and assaulted by Josh. It is a violent, terrifying would-be rape. But it is also completely fake. A blooper happens and the performers break out in laughter.Days later, Ashley stops by the company's office to see the proprietor, Mike. Mike invites her to do the companys website Lucky Bastard, in which a lucky fan gets the chance to have sex with a porn star. Ashley flatly refuses, finding the concept loathsome, unsafe and unprofessional -- she is a single mother and her idea of adult content is doing her taxes and shopping at the grocery store. Mike shows her an innocuous application video by one fan, Dave G. (Jay Paulson), and bribes Ashley into the appearance.The company sets out to film the segment. Mike travels in his S.U.V. with Casey and Ashley, as well as Kris (Chris Wylde), the website cameraman, to pick up the contest's winner. Casey, Mikes latest girlfriend/porn star/plaything, asks if she can use a camera as well, and her footage joins with Kriss and cameras in the car to record the proceedings.The crew picks up the Lucky Bastard, Dave G, at the Amtrak station, where Mike and Dave immediately get off on the wrong foot. Dave has worn a Dodgers T-shirt, and Mike chastises him to change it (Major league baseball will sue our balls off!). The extent of Mikes belittling, insulting attitude towards his site's viewers becomes clear. Really? Kris asks. Right off the bat with the contemptuous prick?Inside the car, the filming goes no better: Dave is awkward, trying to please -- but uncomfortable with the interview that Mike insists is part of Lucky Bastard. They take Dave to a restaurant to film him dining with Ashley, where Dave argues that people like him never watch this portion of the website anyway -- we skip to the sex. They're interrupted by the maitre d (Angela Shin) who says they cannot film an adult production on the premises.As Mike argues with the maitre d, Dave tries to talk to Ashley and, in the background, clearly says the wrong thing. Ashley looks horrified, gets up and walks to the car. Ashley explains to Mike that Dave asked her out on a date and knew personal details about her -- what is he, a stalker? Casey suggests that Dave simply apologize, and his heartfelt explanation of being well-meaning and nervous convinces Ashley to give him another shot.The company relocates to a house -- the very same house as in the prologue, which, we learn, was outfitted with cameras for a reality show and thus is set up to film everything that takes place. Ashley and Dave film their sex scene, which becomes a fiasco. Dave climaxes prematurely -- that is, almost immediately, without even taking off his bathrobe -- and pushes Ashley to the floor in a panic.This time, Ashley is furious. She yells at Dave (you cant push a woman!) and rages to Mike that the whole thing is sick and a new personal low. She locks herself in a spare room, effectively freezing the production. Mike pleads with her to let him in. She opens the door and he apologizes, heartfelt; he offers to send Dave home at once and Ashley gratefully agrees.Dave, however, is enraged that he is not being given an opportunity to finish his sex scene -- Im the lucky bastard, he insists. He attempts to steal the video footage of his failure but Mike screams at him (Its mine! I paid for it, you signed the form!) and now Daves humiliation is complete: he has been insulted, belittled, revealed as sexually dysfunctional, physically intimidated, and exposed as weak in every way. And the whole thing is soon to be broadcast on a website.Mike orders his assistant Nico (Lanny Joon) to drive Dave to the station, and Nico -- out of discomfort and fear -- makes the fatal mistake of leaving the car cameras running. You think Im gonna do something? Dave asks. No, Nico replies, Id just feel more comfortable with them on.' Dave has finally had too much: he goes to pee in the bushes -- a ruse to get a rock--comes back, and bashes Nicos head in. Dave is now a monster, unleashed.Back at the house, Mike has summoned a male porn star -- Josh, from the prologue -- to film a scene with Ashley so he at least has something to show on the website. Dave infiltrates the house and, in his rage at being humiliated, one by one stalks, captures, and kills (by baseball bat or handgun) Mike and the crew. Each time, it is a comeuppance for the insults that Dave earlier endured.Finally it is just Ashley and Dave. But she alone has the strength, wits and sex appeal to outwit the deranged Dave. She seduces him, tricking him into untying her. They have sex, and after he climaxes -- whimpering and gentle -- she crushes his genitals, scrambles for the gun, and blows his brains out.She screams a primal scream of agony, then sits, shaken and shocked to be alive. What now? She looks right into the camera, which Dave had left running to film his conquest. She has a wry, angry, knowing look. She has had a complicated emotional relationship with the camera and her role in front of it. For her, that role is over. She gets up and turns the camera OFF.","violence, cruelty, murder, sadist",train,imdb

They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down.

Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle.

He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on.

Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk.

Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates.
